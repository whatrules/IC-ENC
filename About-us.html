			"IC-ENC aims to provide services, at a low cost, to national Hydrographic Offices that ensure their ENCs are compliant to
			the international standards, consistent across the global dataset, and readily available for use. This is so that shipping
			can navigate safely, efficiently and confidently, whilst ensuring other maritime users are using the same approved data"

		<h1 >Who is IC-ENC?</h1>
			
		<p>
		
			The International Centre for ENCs (IC-ENC) is a low cost, not for profit organisation which was set up in 2002 with a remit to assist 
			Hydrographic Offices (HOs) in harmonising the production and distribution of high quality ENCs. This is achieved through ENC validation 
			and distribution processes, always with the mariner in mind. IC-ENC is a Regional ENC Coordinating Centre (RENC), which supports the 
			achievement of the IHO Worldwide Electronic Navigational Chart Database (WEND) principles.
		
		</P>

		<p>
		
			IC-ENC provides four main services to each member HO:
		
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>Independent ENC Validation</li>
			<li>ENC Production Support</li>
			<li>ENC Distribution</li>
			<li>ENC Revenue Management</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<br>

		<h1>How is IC-ENC Governed?</h1>
			
		<p>
		
			IC-ENC is lead by an independent chairman and vice-chair, who work closely with the IC-ENC General Manager to ensure the policies and goals set by the IC-ENC 
			Steering Committee are achieved. The chair positions are re-elected on a two year basis. All member HOs are encouraged to participate in the annual Steering 
			Committee meeting, as well as the Technical Experts Working Group (TEWG) which is attended by both IC-ENC staff and specialists from member HOs in order to 
			recommend policies to the Steering Committee. All decisions are reached by consensus, with a voting system defined if consensus is not possible. Between 
			meetings, decisions can be taken through correspondence via a circular letter to the Steering Committee.

		<h1>How is IC-ENC funded?</h1>
			
		<p>
		
			IC-ENC is a low cost, not for profit organisation which is financed out of ENC sales. IC-ENC's costs are recovered by retaining a 'fixed fee' per sale of each ENC 
			subscription. The 'fixed fee' amount is decided by the Steering Committee, based upon costs and sales forecasts. Once the 'fixed fee' is set for the year ahead, each 
			IC-ENC member is free to set its own wholesale ENC price. This way, IC-ENC members know for certain how much revenue they will receive for each ENC 
			subscription sold. The 'fixed fee' currently stands at $1.
		
		</p>
		
		<br>
			
		<h1>Why is IC-ENC Important?</h1>
			
		<p>
		
			With the introduction of ENCs, and the IHO WEND principles, each HO is now responsible for ENC coverage of the waters under its national jurisdiction. Under the 
			relevant standards, each HO is free to derive its own cell schema; to define its approach to populating and encoding the ENC data for display; and to determine its 
			methods for distributing the ENC data. IC-ENC's experience from studying and working with ENC data from over 30 member HOs has shown that many different approaches 
			to scheming, populating, encoding and distributing ENCs have already been adopted by the international HO community. Therefore, close cooperation 
			between the various HOs is essential to the whole ENC concept, and the successful transfer to official digital chart products. This is why IC-ENC focuses on 
			providing coordination and standardisation services at both regional and international levels. By operating within a harmonised quality and distribution framework, IC-
			ENC members effectively avoid these problems, and therefore benefit from much broader use of their ENC data.
