				​Firstly, thank you for all of your positive comments on the first blog post; I'm so glad
				that you enjoyed reading it. As a result, I'm back with blog number two!
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC is now half way through the first training course of 2015, which is being held
				here in Taunton for a two week period from 2nd – 13th February.  Eleven delegates
				were selected to attend the course from various different regions of the world:
				Belgium, Egypt, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, South
				Africa, and Spain.  So far, the delegates have been learning about IC-ENC's roles
				and responsibilities, as well as its core processes such as how we download and
				register data from our members.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				The training course aims to provide the knowledge and skills required to carry out
				the various aspects of ENC Validation back at their home offices.  In addition,
				delegates will be able to demonstrate an understanding of IC-ENC, the relevant
				international standards, and the content and construction of ENCs by validating
				ENC data and investigating the reported errors.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We also intend for our training courses to bring our members together to share
				ideas and build strong working relationships with one another, therefore showing us
				as a truly international organisation.  In addition, the delegates also have the
				opportunity to meet and build working relationships with the team at the IC-ENC UK
				office.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				There will be two more training courses delivered during 2015, one in Latin America
				and one in Australia.  If you are interested in attending one of our training courses,
				please see the IC-ENC website or contact Mike Hawes (Course Instructor) at
				mike.hawes@ic-enc.org for more information.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We have also enjoyed a visit from Dr Mathias Jonas, IC-ENC Chairman, to the IC-
				ENC HQ office in Taunton on 5th February.  Mathias was introduced to the course
				delegates before spending the rest of the day with the each member of the IC-ENC
				team to gain a full understanding of all the services IC-ENC provides, as well as
				some of the current project work that each team member is working on.

				On the data front, IC-ENC has now released all of the Italian ENCs to the market
				place for distribution by our VARs.  As a result, 253 additional ENCs have been
				added to our catalogue, which brings our total number of issued ENCs to 5,473!

				This month also saw the release of Real Time Reporting (RTR), the new IC-ENC
				business system, which has been one of Richard Northover's main projects since he
				joined as IC-ENC Commercial Manager in March 2014.  The main features of the
				system include automated XML based sales orders, from VARs, submitted on a 24
				hour basis via email, fully automated sales order processing, immediate automated
				VAR receipts or error reports via email, and automated monthly VAR invoicing.  This
				new system will provide immediate benefits including a robust, streamlined and
				automated sales order process for both the VARs and IC-ENC with the elimination
				of manually induced errors. In addition, RTR will provide the ability to customise
				reporting for members on far more elements than has previously been possible.

				Further afield, James will be attending the 6th Meeting of the RSAHC, which will be
				held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 9th – 11th February. James will be
				there to meet with current and potential members, so please do go and introduce
				yourself if you are also attending.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Looking ahead to September, IC-ENC is pleased to announce that this year's
				Steering Committee Meeting will be held in Munich from 7th – 8th September. The
				meeting will be held at the Holiday Inn Munich – City Centre hotel. All invitations
				were sent out on Friday 23rd January, so please make every effort to respond by
				Monday 16th February, and if you have any questions please contact me at
				laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org.
