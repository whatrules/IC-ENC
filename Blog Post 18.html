				​It's been a busy month down here in IC-ENC. In addition to hosting our first training
				course of 2015, we have also had a sharp rise in the amount of incoming data which
				has kept the validation team occupied (to say the least!), as well as several
				meetings and visits.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Following on from the first week of the training course, the delegates spent the
				weekend exploring the local area. On Saturday, a few of the delegates spent the
				day in Bath, and on Sunday, IC-ENC organised a day trip down to Lyme Regis, a
				small seaside town on the South coast of England. Luckily it was a lovely sunny day
				(the past few days it had been pouring with rain!), so the delegates were able to
				make the most of it. We also organised a couple of evenings during the two week
				period for the team and the delegates to relax and enjoy a friendly drink together.

				Some of the topics covered in the second week included data consistency, where
				the delegates were able to discuss their views on the use of SCAMIN and the
				problems associated with overlapping data in detail, as well as the distribution of
				data where the delegates learnt about S-63 (Data Protection Scheme) and the route
				to the market place via the IC-ENC VARs. In addition, the delegates had the
				opportunity to get hands on with the Transas ECDIS, helping them to put some of
				their learning into practice.

				The next course is scheduled to take place from 25th May to 5th June, and will be
				held at the Australian Hydrographic Office (AHS), located in Wollongong, Australia.
				Invitations for the delegates selected to attend this course will be sent out very
				shortly.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				On a final note, we hope that those of you who attended our first training course
				enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed hosting it!

				On the data front, we are pleased to announce that the first 17 Philippines cells sent
				to IC-ENC were released to the market place for distribution by our VARs on 27th
				February 2015. As of week 10, this addition brings our total number of issued ENCs
				to 5,500!​

				Richard Fowle, IC-ENC Technical Manager, attended the Joint TSMAD29 and
				DIPWG7 meeting which was held in Ottawa, Canada from 2nd-6th February. The
				meeting was well attended by both Hydrographic Offices and Industries. Individual
				reports were given to the meeting group regarding the activities of other IHO
				Working Groups and organisations, and as a result there were some good
				discussions surrounding the topics of S-58, S-100 and S-101. Some of the main
				outcomes of the meeting were the further developments regarding S-101, and the
				restructuring of TSMAD and DIPWG, which have now been replaced by the S-
				100WG and ENCWG. If you are interested in finding out more about the Joint
				TSMAD29 and DIPWG7 meeting, the minutes will be available on the IHB website
				in the near future. In addition, more information on the new S-100WG and ENCWG
				can be found on the IHO website.

				James attended the 6th RSAHC meeting in Abu Dhabi, which took place from 9th-
				11th February. James presented on IC-ENC services, with a particular focus on
				capacity building and our first training course of 2015. The presentation was well
				received, and some interesting questions were asked. Additionally, James met
				several new contacts from our existing members Pakistan and Bahrain, and
				continued to develop IC-ENC's relationship with several prospective new members.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				On 27th February, We had a visit from Commander Nickolás Roscher, Directorate of
				Hydrography and Navigation at the Brazilian HO (DHN). Nickolás spent the day with
				the team, learning about our core services and some of the main processes we
				perform on a daily basis. We believe that visits such as these provide a
				great opportunity to develop and strengthen our working relationships with one
				another.

				<br>
				
				James and Mathias have also just attended the 5th WENDWG meeting, which was
				held in Singapore from 3rd – 5th March. At the meeting, James presented a RENC
				progress report, based on the 2014 Annual Report, which was well received by the
				group and sparked some interesting discussions. The main topics of discussion
				included the issues surrounding overlapping data, and the method of assessing
				progress on delivering adequate ENC coverage to support the mandation of ECDIS,
				the IHO ENC catalogue, and the S-101 future standard. As a direct result of this
				meeting, IC-ENC will be collaborating with the Maritime and Port Authority of
				Singapore (MPA) in order to investigate the effects of overlapping ENCs on various
				types of ECDIS, including both behaviour and display of data.
