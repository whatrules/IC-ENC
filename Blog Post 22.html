				​I hope you all had a lovely Easter break, and you've returned feeling refreshed! ​
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Firstly, a quick update on SC16. I will be starting to book flights for SC16 imminently,
				so if you have not yet returned your travel forms to me, please make every effort to
				do so as soon as possible. Please remember that IC-ENC has opted to pay for the
				travel and accommodation costs of one delegate per nation, so if you would like to
				send more than one delegate, the additional travel and accommodation costs must
				be met your organisation.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC has had visits from several nations this month, including both some familiar
				faces from the Netherlands Hydrographic Office, and some new faces from
				the Myanmar Naval Hydrographic Centre and several Omani students who are
				currently on a two week training course at the UK Hydrographic Office. We hope all
				of our visitors enjoyed meeting and spending some time with the team, we certainly
				did!​
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The dataflow within IC-ENC remains at a high, and as a result, our total number of
				ENCs released now stands at 5,558 ENCs as of week 18.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				For those producing nations using 7Cs ENC Analyzer, we'd like to bring to your
				attention the change in criteria which has resulted in the error message
				'VS57_ATT_49' being reported in our validation work much more frequently. – you
				may have noticed in your validation reports! This has occurred since we have
				upgraded ENC Analyzer to version 3.3.1.218568. The error m​essage reports that
				the mandatory attributes CATREA (category of restriction) and RESTRN (restriction)
				are missing for RESARE (restricted area).
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Previously, the error would only be reported if both mandatory attributes were
				missing, but now the error will be reported even if one of the mandatory attributes
				has been populated. If this is the case, and one mandatory attribute has been
				populated, the error can be classified as 'erroneous', and no further action would be
				required. However, if both mandatory attributes are missing or left empty and there
				is no additional information about the nature of the restricted area in INFORM or
				TXTDSC, then the error will be classified as 'HO to correct'. To resolve the error, at
				least one of the mandatory attributes must be populated, or alternatively, if it is
				easier to describe the nature of the restricted area, then INFORM or TXTDSC can
				be populated.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We are now looking forward to the next IC-ENC International Validation training
				course, which is to be held in Wollongong, Australia from 25th May until 5th June, for
				a period of two weeks. There are now 12 confirmed delegates on the course,
				attending from Australia, Bahrain, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan and the
				Philippines. Mike Hawes, Course Instructor, is very much looking forward to meeting
				all of the delegates in Wollongong on 25th May.
