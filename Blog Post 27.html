				It's been another busy month for IC-ENC, with new staff members,
				various international meetings and visits, Steering Committee preparations, and no
				let up on the data front. ​
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				​IC-ENC attended two Hydrographic Commissions this month​. James attended the
				Mediterranean and Black Sea Hydrographic Commission meeting (MBSHC), held in
				Batumi, Georgia from 29th June - 2nd July. It was a productive meeting with good
				discussions regarding ENHD and IC-ENC's combined efforts on ENC production in
				the Suez Canal, and ENC scheming in the general area.

					span.onclick = function() {

					}
				</script>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Subsequently, Richard Fowle attended the South East Pacific Hydrographic
				Commission meeting (SEPHC), held in Guayaquil, Ecuador from 13th – 16th July.
				Richard updated the commission on IC-ENC's capacity building initiatives, including
				the IC-ENC International Validation training course, and also on IC-ENC's revised
				policy regarding overlapping data and areas of responsibility. Richard also spent
				some time discussing new ENC production plans with Ecuador.

				<i>​South East Pacific Hydrographic Commission (SEPHC 12) 13th - 16th July, Guayaquil, Ecuador</i>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Dan Garratt, IC-ENC Data Validator, has recently gained promotion to IC-ENC
				Senior Data Validator following a successful interview. The main objectives of the
				IC-ENC Senior Data Validator role are to maintain the IC-ENC documentation which
				underpins the IC-ENC Production Support and ENC Validation services; carry out
				IC-ENC Production Support and Validation services when required; to achieve and
				maintain ISO9001 quality management certification for all IC-ENC operations across
				all IC-ENC offices; and to develop the culture of customer focus and continual
				improvement across the IC-ENC organisation.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				This month, we also held a secondment for Gailen Helga Pietersen, an employee of
				the South African Navy Hydrographic Office (SANHO), from 6th – 10th July. Gailen
				spent her the first part of the week with Mike, IC-ENC Data Manager/IC-ENC
				Course Instructor, in order to familiarise her with IC-ENC's core services. Gailen
				then spent time with each member of the Validation team, who took her through the
				entire Validation process.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We were pleased to welcome Scott Drayton, our new IC-ENC Assistant Technical
				Manager, to the team on 20th July. Scott will be working in IC-ENC for a contracted
				period of 12 months to deliver improvements to IC-ENC services and information
				technology as defined in IC-ENC's Target Operating Model.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We were also delighted to welcome Dr. Mathias Jonas, IC-ENC Chairman and
				Hydrographer of the German Hydrographic Office (BSH), to IC-ENC HQ on Tuesday
				28th July. Mathias spent the day discussing some of the agenda topics for the fast
				approaching Steering Committee16 meeting. In addition, Mathias was briefed on
				some of the ongoing projects within IC-ENC by individual members of the team.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Steering Committee 16 is approaching swiftly, and IC-ENC is currently working on
				the discussion papers for the meeting. All discussion papers will be circulated one
				month before the meeting takes place to allow delegates to familiarise themselves
				with the topics listed for discussion in the agenda. If you have not yet replied to your
				invitation, but you would like to attend, please send your travel form to me as soon
				as possible on laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Shortly after Steering Committee 16, our third and final IC-ENC International
				Validation training course of 2015 will be taking place in Panama from 14th – 25th
				September. Mike, IC-ENC Course Instructor/IC-ENC Data Manager, is currently
				working hard to ensure all of the final arrangements for the course are under way for
				the 15 delegates who will be attending the training course in September.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Lastly, we are sad to inform you that Sidney Osborne has recently announced
				his retirement from his post at the South African Hydrographic Office (SANHO). We
				have been in correspondence with Sidney since IC-ENC was set up in 2002, with
				South Africa being one of IC-ENC's first members. Below are a few words from
				Sidney himself:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"IC-ENC and the South African Hydrographic Office have had a long and very fruitful
				relationship over the years, so I certainly will reflect warmly on the great times I've
				had with many of the IC-ENC members, past and present here in South Africa and
				abroad. Without singling out any members at IC-ENC, I would like to convey my
				best wishes to all who may remember me, and I hope they continue to enjoy their
				careers in the unique world of ENCs and IC-ENC. I am also that sure those who
				follow in my footsteps in the SANHO will also discover and experience first hand the
				good cordial manner in which IC-ENC provides the valuable service to its
				members".
