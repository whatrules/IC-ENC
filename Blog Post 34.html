				Mike Hawes, IC-ENC Course Trainer/Data Manager has just delivered the third and
				final IC-ENC ENC Validation Training Course of 2015 (bronze level). The course
				was held in Panama for a period of two weeks, from 14th – 25th September. The
				course was delivered to 18 delegates from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba,
				Ecuador, Panama Canal Authority, Panama Maritime Authority, Peru, Suriname,
				Uruguay, United States, and Venezuela.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				On behalf of the whole IC-ENC team, I'd like to say a big thank you to the Panama
				Canal Authority, in particular Jaime Rodriguez, for offering IC-ENC their training
				facilities to host the training course.

				Richard Northover, IC-ENC Commercial Manager, attended the World ECDIS Day
				event, which was held in Hamburg on 16th September. Richard briefed three groups
				of shipping companies, OEM reps and members of the shipping community. He also
				gave a joint RENC presentation with Hans Lauritzen, PRIMAR Director, which was
				well received.

				The annual IC-ENC Steering Committee meeting took place on 7th and 8th
				September in Munich, Germany. We had a record number of 51 attendees,
				representing 31 out of our 36 member Hydrographic offices. The meeting was very
				successful, with some good discussions and decisions made, and the minutes from
				the meeting have now been circulated for review. If you have any comments or
				questions regarding the minutes, please email me on laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org (cc:
				therenc@ic-enc.org) by Friday 2nd October.

				We are excited to announce our latest IC-ENC member developments: Israel, Oman
				and NOAA (US). The Survey of Israel (SOI) joined as our 36th member in August.
				We will be working with SOI to develop its in-house production capabilities in order
				to assist in the production and maintenance of their ENC data. The Oman National
				Hydrographic Office (ONHO) joined as our 37th member during the Steering
				Committee meeting. ONHO currently has seven ENCs, and IC-ENC will provide
				further support in order to assist the development of its in-house ENC production
				capabilities. In addition, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
				(NOAA) have entered into the initial phase of becoming our 38th member. This
				decision was reached following the Steering Committee's endorsement of the
				proposal to establish a fourth IC-ENC regional office in Washington, DC, USA, as
				well as the approval of NOAA's intended membership. The membership
				arrangements and inclusion of the new office into IC-ENC's global operating
				framework are now subject to further analysis and development by both the NOAA
				and IC-ENC teams. Further announcements will be made in due course.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Lastly, whilst we're on the subject of IC-ENC regional offices, I thought I'd take this
				opportunity to update you all on the progress being made at the IC-ENC Latin
				America regional office in Niteroi, Brazil. The office accommodation has now been
				established, and the appointed staff members are now working in the office and
				taking part in regular online meetings with IC-ENC HQ. The two appointed Data
				Validators have just completed the bronze level training course in Panama, and
				formal gold level training is planned to be held in Taunton at a later date.​
