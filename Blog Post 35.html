				IC-ENC has selected the new ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS as a tool to provide
				their 37 member nations with​ to supplement ENC production and validation
				processes.  This will give each member Hydrographic Office the opportunity to load
				their ENCs into an ECDIS in order that the maritime user's perspective can be
				considered and to check its interoperability with adjacent data.  
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				​The SevenCs display engine inside the ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS is used by
				30% of all ECDIS and ECS users within the SOLAS market, allowing IC-ENC and its
				members to make a representative data assessment on a user friendly ECDIS,
				whilst following the latest performance standards.  The ChartWorld eGlobe G2
				ECDIS software will be supplied to those member nations following attendance on
				IC-ENC's International ENC Validation training course.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC has delivered three International ENC Validation training courses this year,
				each held in a different part of the world. The first training course was held in
				Taunton, UK, in February 2015.  The second was held in Wollongong, Australia, in
				May, and the third course has just been delivered in Panama, Central America
				during September.  The course provides its members with the knowledge and skills
				required to perform data validation at their home ENC production offices.  The
				training course runs for a period of two weeks, and runs through the entire ENC
				Validation process from start to finish, as well as providing an overview of IC-ENC's
				additional three core services:  ENC production support, ENC distribution and ENC
				revenue management.  One specific element of the course is designed to enable
				each user to gain the maximum benefit from the ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The Slovenian Hydrographic Office commented: "The most useful parts of the
				course were being able to get to know the whole process of validation from start to
				finish, and meeting IC-ENC staff members and representatives of other
				Hydrographic Office to exchange information and experiences amongst ourselves".
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC will be holding three further training courses in 2016, for which a further
				ECDIS delivery schedule plan will be implemented.​
