				​A shorter update this month, but I will start with some good news!
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We are excited to announce the release of the first Slovenian ENC; a great
				achievement for the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia. This ENC will be released on 6th
				November 2015.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC prides itself on the provision of assistance to its members, regardless of
				when they joined or the extent of their ENC production capability. It is fantastic to
				see how well the ENC production staff at the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia have
				benefited from IC-ENC's Independent ENC Validation and ENC Production Support
				services, as well as IC-ENC's International ENC Validation Training Course. As part
				of their production plan, the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia intend to release a further
				4 ENCs during 2016.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				James has just returned from the PRIMAR Advisory Committee (PAC) meeting in
				Paris, where he was briefed on PRIMAR's developments over the past year. As
				agreed at the last Steering Committee (SC16), the Open Sessions will now cease.
				Instead, a series of more regular meetings will take place between the Chairs and
				Management of IC-ENC and PRIMAR, with written reports submitted following each
				PAC and SC meeting.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We also had a visit from the Turkish Hydrographic Office last week to discuss the
				next Steering Committee meeting, which Turkey has kindly offered to host, as well
				as to spend some time with the team at IC-ENC HQ.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Richard Northover, IC-ENC Commercial Manager, has finished preparing the Q3
				sales reports and new ENC wholesale pricing list, both of which will be distributed to
				members imminently.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The IC-ENC Technical Team have been very busy working on the new technology
				developments, and carrying out various forms of testing to ensure that the systems
				are ready to be implemented. This is an exciting time for IC-ENC as we migrate to a
				Cloud-based working environment, whilst facilitating consistency between all IC-
				ENC regional offices, and the growth of IC-ENC as a whole. ​​
