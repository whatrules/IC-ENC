				<h6>Slovenia releases first ENC</h6>

				<div class="news-card-author"><p>by Laura Tyzack at 15:30 in Announcements</p></div>

				<br>

				IC-ENC is excited to announce the release of the first Slovenian ENC, produced by
				the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia.  This ENC will be released to the IC-ENC VARs
				for distribution on 6th November 2015.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Although the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia started the production of ENCs a few
				years ago, and completed a substantial amount of work, they were unable to
				validate it properly and issue ENCs formally without being a member of a RENC.
				Since joining IC-ENC in July 2014 as IC-ENC's 31st member nation, the Geodetic
				Institute of Slovenia has benefited from IC-ENC's full support to develop its in-house
				ENC production capacity through IC-ENC's Independent ENC Validation, Production
				Support and Capacity Building (training) services.  IC-ENC prides itself on the
				provision of assistance to its members, regardless of when they joined or their ENC
				production capability. IC-ENC's ENC Production services include direct contact with the
				IC-ENC Validation Team via email, telephone and Skype.  The IC-ENC
				Validation Team strive to provide timely responses to any issues, queries or general
				feedback from members.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Above all, the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia has greatly benefitted from attending
				IC-ENC's International ENC Validation Training Course.  Matija Klanjšček,
				Cartographer, attended the training course in February 2015, along with nine other
				delegates from different Hydrographic Offices.  Matija thoroughly enjoyed the
				training opportunity, highlighting that he has noticed significant improvements to his
				understanding of ENC production and ENC validation processes. He also
				emphasized how great it was to meet the IC-ENC staff and representatives of other
				Hydrographic Offices to exchange information and experiences.  As a result, he was
				more than happy to present his feedback to the IC-ENC Steering Committee during
				this year's meeting held back in September.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC has delivered three International ENC Validation training courses during
				2015, held in Taunton (UK), Wollongong (Australia) and Panama (Central America).
				The training course provides its members with the knowledge and skills required to
				perform data validation at their home ENC production offices.  The training course
				runs for a period of two weeks, and runs through the entire ENC Validation process
				from start to finish, as well as providing an overview of IC-ENC's additional three
				core services:  ENC production support, ENC distribution and ENC revenue
				management. One specific element of the course is designed to enable each user to
				gain the maximum benefit from the ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS, which IC-ENC
				has selected as a tool to provide its 38 member nations with to supplement ENC
				production and validation processes.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC will be holding three further training courses in 2016.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Following the release of the first ENC, the Port of Koper (Band 5), Slovenia plan to
				continue with ENC production covering the wider area of Bay of Koper (Band 4),
				and eventually covering the whole territorial waters of the Republic of Slovenia with
				another ENC of a smaller scale.
