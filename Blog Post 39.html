				​Welcome back! I hope you all had a lovely break, and you've come back feeling
				refreshed and ready for a 2016 full of fresh possibilities.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We are pleased to announce that 10 ENCs from the Panama Maritime Authority
				were released on 22nd December 2015 (week 52 exchange set). This is an exciting
				time for the Panama Maritime Authority, and we look forward to working with them
				further in due course.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				​We look forward to welcoming two delegates from NOAA, who will be the new IC-
				ENC North America Validators, at the end of January. We also look forward to
				welcoming back the two delegates from the Diretoria de Hidrografia e Navegação
				(DHN) in Brazil​, who previously spent three weeks with us at IC-ENC HQ in
				November 2015. These four delegates will be spending three months at IC-ENC HQ
				on secondment​​ in order to provide IC-ENC ​​Validation and Regional Office training
				for when they start their roles at the new IC-ENC Latin America and IC-ENC North
				America regional offices.​
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				In addition, we will be welcoming a delegation from Venezuela to IC-ENC HQ
				from 7th - 16th March 2016. We look forward to spending time with the delegation to
				discuss ENC Production and ENC Validation matters.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We are currently in the process of organising the IC-ENC Technical Conference,
				which will be held in Taunton, UK during the week commencing 25th April 2016. The
				conference will run over the course of three days, with one main topic listed for
				discussion each day. These topics will include S-57, S-100 and S-101 and the IC-
				ENC Validation Service and Technology. The proposed format is:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Day 1: S-57:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				• Report from IHO ENC Working Group
				<br>
				• Sharing of best practice encoding techniques (recent changes)
				<br>
				• Changes and publication of S-58 version xx: what does this mean to the
				  encoder?
				<br>
				• Optional session: eGlobe ECDIS training (including installation process).
				  Applicable to those members who have not already received the software form
				  IC-ENC. This will complete the ECDIS roll out to all members
				 
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Day 2: S-100 & S-101:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				• Report from IHO S101 Working Group, including timeline
				<br>
				• Review of each member national position with respect to the new ENC
				standard. (A questionnaire will have been completed by each member prior to
				the Conference)
				<br>
				• Establish parameters for IC-ENC S-101 support to members
				<br>
				• Set plan for IC-ENC to develop the concept further to present to SC17
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Day 3: IC-ENC Validation Service and Technology - Changes and Improvements our
				members need to know:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				• IC-ENC Global Operating model (role of HQ and regional offices)
				<br>
				• IC-ENC Errors Database improvements
				<br>
				• IC-ENC website and support information (log in area)
				<br>
				• Data Transfer methodology
				<br>
				• Plans for 2016 Bronze IC-ENC ENC Validation courses (SC decision SC16/9)
				<br>
				• Plans 2017 and 2018: Discuss future of the TEWG/Technical Conference 
				format/frequency/structure – what will give most benefit to members.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				​As we are expecting a high level of attendance, IC-ENC will cover the travel and
				accommodation costs for one delegate from each member HO. If an HO wishes to
				send more than one delegate, we will ask the HO to cover the travel and
				accommodation costs for the additional delegates. The venue, and further details
				will be provided as soon as possible.
