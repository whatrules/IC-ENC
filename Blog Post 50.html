			<h6>International Team Training</h6>

			The IC-ENC Validation Team have been busy training to use the new internal
			validation tool that has been developed to replace the Data Management Database
			(DMD) system.

			<br>
			<br>

			The International Teams from the Australia, North America and Latin America offices
			joined the rest of the team at IC-ENC UK for three weeks during January/February.
			During this time, the team were introduced to the new bespoke software tool in
			order to familiarise themselves with some of the new functionality and processes,
			whilst acting as a final User Acceptance Testing process, reporting back any issues
			encountered. During the final week, the team began to conduct their validations
			using the new tool and share ideas regarding new best practice.

			<br>
			<br>

			The International Teams emphasised the benefit of having the team in one place to
			maximise learning and understanding of the new tool during a short period of time,
			as the team were able to share ideas for best practice and discuss any issues they
			encountered during the training. This has helped to ensure that they felt confident in
			using the tool upon returning to their home offices. Their training and performance
			progress was overseen by the IC-ENC Data Manager as part of the team's
			Continuous Professional Development.

			<br>
			<br>

			As well as a productive three weeks of training, the team made sure they made the
			most of their time together in the UK by organising several out-of-office team
			building/social events, equally important as the functional training.
