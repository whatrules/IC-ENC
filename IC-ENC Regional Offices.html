		<h2>IC-ENC Latin America</h2>

		<p>IC-ENC Australia was set up in 2005, and is hosted by the Australian Hydrographic Service (AHS). The offices are located in 
		Wollongong, New South Wales. IC-ENC Australia operates with one part-time Manager and one Full time validator.</p>

		<p>IC-ENC Australia provides local support to those members in the region, Australia and New Zealand. The ability to have 
		validation issues dealt with in a timely manner with staff responsive to member needs working in a similar time zone is regarded as very advantageous.</p>

	   <h2>IC-ENC Latin America</h2>

		<p>IC-ENC Latin America is currently under development. This new regional office will be developed in partnership with the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation 
		(DHN) and will be located in the Niter√≥i offices of DHN, near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>

		<p>The first stage is for IC-ENC to train DHN staff in the IC-ENC ENC quality assurance practices, who will then be considered 'on loan' to IC-ENC.  The stringent IC-
		ENC requirements in terms of staff performance and competence will be reached during 2015, with the IC-ENC Latin America office achieving full operating 
		capability in early 2016.</p>

		<p>IC-ENC Latin America will be responsible for validating data for those members in the region: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, 
		Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The office will be run by one part-time Manager and two full time validators.</p>

		<h2>IC-ENC North America</h2>

		<p>IC-ENC North America is currently under development. This new regional office will be developed in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
		Administration (NOAA), who have entered into the initial phase of becoming the 38th national hydrographic office to join IC-ENC. </p>

		<p>The 2015 IC-ENC annual Steering Committee meeting in Munich, Germany approved NOAA's intended membership of IC-ENC and endorsed a proposal for NOAA 
		and IC-ENC to establish a fourth regional office of IC-ENC in Washington, DC, USA. </p>

		<p>The membership arrangements, and the inclusion of the new office into IC-ENC's global operating framework, are now subject to detailed analysis and 
		development by the NOAA and IC-ENC teams.  Further announcements will follow as the IC-ENC North America office develops full operating capability during 
		2016. </p>

		<p>NOAA currently produces and maintains over 1000 ENCs.  IC-ENC's Production Support including Capacity Building (Training) and Independent Validation 
		services will be delivered to NOAA via the IC-ENC North America office.  The NOAA ENCs will form part of the global IC-ENC folio, and be included in IC-ENC's 
		ENC Distribution service, achieved through the main IC-ENC office in the UK, </p>

		<p>IC-ENC is looking forward to working in partnership with NOAA and assisting in sustaining this important ENC coverage. </p>
