		<h1>IC-ENC Errors Database</h1>

		<p>The IC-ENC Validation team have had many years of experience using the validation software tools, which report potential issues with ENC files in the form of error 
		messages.</p>

		<p>However, the validation tools have often reported errors erroneously, or in an ambiguous manner. The software is also routinely changing, which means that the ‘ground 
		rules’ never remain fixed for very long.</p>

		<p>As a way of standardising the validation process, IC-ENC has created, and now maintains, the IC-ENC Errors Database. This database provides detailed information of 
		error messages generated by the various validation software tools and ECDIS systems used during validation. This information includes explanations and examples of 
		each error message encountered, whilst providing the significance of each error and actions to be taken. In addition, each error has a classification which defines the IC-
		ENC policy, i.e. whether the ENC needs to be corrected or not.</p>

		<p>The database is continuously being updated as new error messages and encountered and validation tools are updated.</p>

		<p>The database is available for use by the IC-ENC Validation team and all IC-ENC members via the Hydrographic Offices​ area of the website.​</p>
