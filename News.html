			IC-ENC is proud to announce that the National Mapping and Resource Information
			Authority (NAMRIA) of Philippines has become the 30th National Hydrographic
			Office to join its rapidly increasing family of members.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			NAMRIA has issued ENCs in the General, Approach and Harbour usage bands,
			which is supplemented by coverage produced by  the United Kingdom Hydrographic
			Office.  IC-ENC will now be supporting NAMRIA, to develop further its in-house ENC
			production capacity, via its Production Support, Independent Validation and
			Capacity Building (Training) services. NAMRIA intends to assume production and
			maintenance responsibilities for approximately 150 ENCs of its national waters and
			the surrounding area. This is important new coverage in the IC-ENC ENC folio.

		The 28 IC-ENC member nations have recently achieved a significant landmark in
		their ENC coverage. 
		<br>
		By working together (and with the assistance of the IC-ENC RENC) these nations
		have produced and are maintaining a folio that is now made up of over 5000 ENCs! 
		Each of the co-operating nations has overcome its own unique challenges in order
		to reach this stage of production. 
		<br>
		The combined IC-ENC ENC database with its focus on data quality and consistency
		will grow further as the members continue with their production schedule and new
		nations join the IC-ENC RENC.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The sizes of the individual national folios are shown by this graph:

		It covered RENC aspects such as membership, operations, data flow and

			INAHINA is a long standing member of IC-ENC and is now developing its own national

			<br>

			IC-ENC will be supporting INAHINA’s ambitions via its ENC Production Support service
			and the IC-ENC ENC Validation training course.
			
			<br>
			<br>

			The IC-ENC ENC Validation training course has been developed by IC-ENC’s technical
			experts. It is designed to train its members’ ENC production departments in all aspects of
			ENC validation without favouring any one piece of validation software. The pilot course
			will run in March for selected delegates and be available for other delegates from
			amongst the IC-ENC membership during 2014. For further details relating to this course
			please contact Mike Hawes, IC-ENC Data Manager.

		<div class="news-card-author"><p>by Kevin Black at 11:18 in Technical, IC-ENC Suggests</p></div>

			<br>

			Arno Meurink, Senior Cartographer at the Netherlands Hydrographic Office, has published an article exploring some of the challenges of encoding time-related objects on ENCs. 
			It is based on his experiences of updating Netherlands ENCs for changes to the routing measures between Texel and North Hinder. These changes took effect at 0000 UTC on 1 August 2013 and were one of the most extensive operations involving route changes in the world to date. 
			Arno highlights the challenges in publishing these changes effectively given differences between different ECDIS displays, and the variation in user training. The article can be read here.

			<Br>
			<Br>
			
			Arno and the Netherlands ENC production team have been supported by IC-ENC for a number of years, his experiences are described here
