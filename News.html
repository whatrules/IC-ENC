		  For your general information, last week IC-ENC issued its largest ever exchange set
		  of weekly ENC data. This included 66 New ENCs - the Solomon Islands, and
		  Russian ENCs (the east coast, where a large re-scheme of data has been achieved,
		  with the small scale Band 2 coverage moving to a grid system).
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  Our total files released was 379, exceeding by a significant margin the previous
		  highest weekly total of 336. The 2017 weekly average is closer to 250, and 2016's
		  was closer to 170. Although there have been some cancellations of previous
		  coverage in the Solomon Islands and Russian east coast, this new data takes the
		  size of the IC-ENC ENC folio beyond 7,500.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  This is a great achievement for the Validation team across all of our offices in
		  making this happen.

		  IC-ENC welcomes Solomon Islands, having last week completed the Statement of
		  Intent to Join process. This was achieved through the Australian Hydrographic
		  Service, which is supporting SIMSA in the production and distribution of these ENCs
		  while SIMSA develops its own capabilities. 41 new Solomon Islands ENCs,
		  production code "SB", have now been released through IC-ENC to the VARs.

			 The second IC-ENC Technical Conference took place last week in Copenhagen,
			 Denmark. We had 41 attendees representing 32 of our 41 nations. The
			 conference was a great success and some excellent discussions took place over
			 the three days. 
		 
			<br>
			<br>
			
			A draft version of the conference report will be circulated to the attendees for review 
			shortly. In the meantime, all of the delivered presentations have now been uploaded
			to the Hydrographic Offices area of the website, under the 'Technical Conference'
			heading. You will also find the group photo in the same location.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We hope to see you all again at TC03 next year!

		  The IC-ENC Validation Team have been busy training to use the new internal
		  validation tool that has been developed to replace the Data Management Database
		  (DMD) system.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The International Teams from the Australia, North America and Latin America offices
		  joined the rest of the team at IC-ENC UK for three weeks during January/February.
		  During this time, the team were introduced to the new bespoke software tool in
		  order to familiarise themselves with some of the new functionality and processes,
		  whilst acting as a final User Acceptance Testing process, reporting back any issues
		  encountered. During the final week, the team began to conduct their validations
		  using the new tool and share ideas regarding new best practice.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The International Teams emphasised the benefit of having the team in one place to
		  maximise learning and understanding of the new tool during a short period of time,
		  as the team were able to share ideas for best practice and discuss any issues they
		  encountered during the training. This has helped to ensure that they felt confident in
		  using the tool upon returning to their home offices. Their training and performance
		  progress was overseen by the IC-ENC Data Manager as part of the team's
		  Continuous Professional Development.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  As well as a productive three weeks of training, the team made sure they made the
		  most of their time together in the UK by organising several out-of-office team
		  building/social events, equally important as the functional training.

		 Since The Ports and Yachting Directorate for Transport Malta, joined IC-ENC in
		 February, IC-ENC has been working closely with Malta in order to develop its ENC
		 production capacity.  We are now very happy to announce that IC-ENC will release
		 the first Maltese (MT coded) ENC in this week's IC-ENC exchange set on
		 Friday 29th July 2016, with more to follow in upcoming weeks.
		 
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 
		 Not only is this a great step forward for Malta in terms of providing important
		 coverage for the region, but this also means that IC-ENC has reached a significant
		 milestone of having more than 6,000 ENCs in its folio, which now accounts for 40%
		 of the global folio of released ENCs.

		  We are now part way through the first week of the IC-ENC International ENC
		  Validation training course, which is taking place from 4th-15th July at the United
		  Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) in Taunton, UK. Eleven delegates from nine
		  nations have joined us for two weeks to learn about the ENC Validation process
		  from start to finish, thus giving them the knowledge and skills to be able to perform
		  ENC Validation when they return to their home offices. The course will also include
		  familiarisation with the eGlobe G2 ECDIS in order to encourage the use of ECDIS in
		  Hydrographic Offices' ENC production and validation processes. All IC-ENC
		  members have been provided with the eGlobe ECDIS software to take back to their
		  home offices.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>

		  Committee 17 meeting, which will take place on 20th and 21st September. As

		  registration deadline has been set to Thursday 30th June.
