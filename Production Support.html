		<h1>ENC Production Support</h1>
		 
		<p>The IC-ENC Validation team provide an expert level of assistance to members before, during and after the ENC production process. Assistance can be given via 
		email, telephone and face-to-face technical visits.</p> 

		<p>Best practice methods of S-57 object capture and attribution are shared with members' production teams, which help to improve production techniques and reduce 
		the future work required by producing HOs.</p> 

		<p>Time is invested with each new member before ENC production commences to assist with the establishment of both cost and time effective ENC production 
		flowlines and software settings.</p> 

		<p>IC-ENC continues to work with established members to identify trends in data capture which can lead to improvements in the product, ensuring that the ENC 
		database is consistent, safe and ready to use.</p> 

		<h2>ECDIS Provision</h2>
		
		<p>IC-ENC has recently announced its latest production support initiative, which is to provide its member nations with ECDIS software in order to 
		supplement their ENC Production and ENC Validation processes. The ECDIS software has been provided by SevenCs, and uses the ChartWorld 
		eGlobe G2 ECDIS software.</p>
		
		<h2>IC-ENC Errors Database</h2>

		<p>IC-ENC also provides assistance to its members via the IC-ENC Errors Database ,which is available online. Please see the 
		<a href="IC-ENCErrorsDatabase.html" class="links">IC-ENC Errors Database page</a> for more information.</p>

		<h2>Technical Experts Working Group</h2>

		<p>Additionally, IC-ENC holds a Technical Experts Working Group (TEWG) every 18 months, which provides member HOs with advice, guidance and 
		support on technical issues related to ENC production. More information about the TEWG can be found on the 
		<a href="TEWG.html" class="links">Technical Experts Working Group</a> page.</p>
