		<h1>Regional Office Concept</h1>

		<p>The regional office concept promotes consistency, efficiency and partnership within the region, and fits neatly into the WEND concept. IC-ENC 
		encourages the development of regional offices, and provides support and training as required.</p>
		
		<Br>

		<h2>What does an IC-ENC Regional Office do?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Validates regional data to the same standard as IC-ENC HQ. The Validation teams in each office use the same software and working practices. The Validation teams work closely together to share best practice and ideas</li>
			<li>Acts as the primary IC-ENC point of contact for members in the region, providing advice and support on ENC issues</li>
			<li>Collates the ENCs that have passed validation and supplies them to IC-ENC HQ on a weekly basis for distribution to the VARs</li>
			<li>The Managers of each office provide input and support as required regarding IC-ENC matters, e.g. strategic issues, meetings and conferences</li>
		</ul>
			
		<Br>	
			
		<h2>What are the benefits of an IC-ENC regional office?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Provision of local support to IC-ENC members, in terms of time-zone and language</li>
			<li>Extended 'working day' for improved response times (up to 20 hours out of 24)</li>
			<li>Enhance the 'international' aspect of IC-ENC, and development of a global network across countries and continents</li>
			<li>Establish a global resource of staff trained in ENC Validation</li>
			<li>Support IC-ENC's International Validation training course, by offering a regional base for training and other capacity building activities</li>
		</ul>
			
		<Br>	
			
		<p><h2>Where are the IC-ENC Regional Offices located?</h2>
		
		IC-ENC has three regional offices:</p>

		<ul>
