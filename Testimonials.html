		<h2>Arno Meurink</h2>
		
		<p>ENC Production. Netherlands Hydrographic Office.</p>
		
		<i>
		<p> My first acquaintance with IC-ENC was in 2009 when I joined 
		our ENC production team. It soon became clear to me that the cooperation with IC-ENC 
		was an important part of my new work (producing ENCs). I used their Errors 
		Database to look up the sometimes very confusing errors and warnings I got 
		from the validation software. Thank you for that!</p>
		
		<p> Especially in the beginning it was very reassuring for me to know that an 
		external and independent party would look at my ENCs before they are 
		released. They are specialized in validating ENCs, and they do also horizontal 
		and vertical checks with the connecting/overlapping ENCs from other 
		countries. I will never forget the moment that my first ENC (Aruba) was 
		released!</p>
		
		<p>Most of the communication with IC-ENC is done by e-mail. This is very 
		practical. The Technical Expert Working Group meetings that they organize 
		are also very valuable. During these meetings you have the opportunity to 
		meet colleagues face-to-face from other countries in an informal way. The 
		presentations and discussions during these meetings have an aim to 
		harmonize the ENCs from all the countries. This will improve the user-
		friendliness of ENCs and the confidence ECDIS users have in their system 
		and that's worth a lot!</p>

		<h2>IHM</h2>
		<p>(Instituto Hidrografico de la Marina, Spain)</p>
		<i>
		<p>The Spanish Navy Hydrographic Office (Instituto Hidrografico de la Marina - 
		IHM) has been a member of IC-ENC since 2004.</p>
		
		<p>In our opinion, being a member of a RENC, in this case IC-ENC, means 
		Quality and Safety for our ENCs. The strong points are Validation and 
		Distribution.Regarding ENC Validation, we are very satisfied both by its 
		unquestionable quality and by the easiness of information exchange between 
		IC-ENC headquarters and IHM.</p>
		
		<p>As far as Distribution is concerned, the fact that a network of assessed VARs 
		(Value-Added Resellers) exists clearly facilitates and broadens the options 
		mariners have to acquire quality ENCs. We have a similar network of 
		agencies in Spain that distribute our paper charts, but it would be very hard 
		for us to distribute our ENCs globally and efficiently were it not for the 
		participation of the IC-ENC VARs.</p>
		
		<p>In addition, being a part of a group of Hydrographic Offices is beneficial since 
		experiences and improvements are constantly exchanged during the 
		meetings of the Steering Committee, the Technical Working Group and/or 
		the Commercial Working Group. Each member has the same privileges and rights 
		in the Steering Committee. Its voice is heard during the meetings and its 
		opinions taken into account. Decisions are made by consensus or, if required, 
		by voting. Each member has one vote, regardless of the number of ENCs it 
		produces. The IC-ENC budget is approved by all of the members. To 
		conclude, we only see advantages in being a participant of IC-ENC.</p>

		<h2>Lieutenant Marcelo Olivera</h2>
		
		<p>SOHMA, Uruguay</p>
		
		<i>
		<p>My arrival at the Hydrographic Office of Uruguay, and my assignment as Head 
		of the Cartography Branch in 2010 coincided with the signing of the 
		agreement between SOHMA and IC-ENC and the first steps on the path to 
		integration to the aforementioned RENC. By then, the challenge was great 
		and of course we do not have any previous experience that supports us.</p>
		
		<p>The process took some time, in which the 'Joining Instructions' were an 
		extremely valuable tool for guidance and orientation. Furthermore, at this 
		stage the patience and support that each of the members of the IC-ENC had 
		with us, assisting and advising us in the process of designing an ENC that 
		meets the standards of validation was invaluable. In January 2012, exactly 
		one year after the delivery of our first batch of cells, they were approved, 
		starting their distribution.</p>
		
		<p>My experience over the years working with the IC-ENC is that human warmth 
		and generous disposition of each of its members, makes contact to be very 
		close. It could be defined as a "group of friends at a distance" which often do 
		not know each other in person, but let your work with ENCs to be a pleasant 
		and enjoyable experience.</p>
		
		<p>Now that I am leaving Cartography Branch in order to take on a new 
		challenge in my naval career, SOHMA has reached 27 cells distributed 
		worldwide through the RENC, with at least 15 additional cells in preparation 
		for this 2015. I would like express my deep appreciation to the staff of IC-ENC 
		for all the learning and experience they have shared with me over the years 
		and the staff of the Electronic Cartography Division of SOHMA, by the tireless 
		effort of preparing products which matches the greater level of world requirement.</p>
		
	  <p>I wish you all "best winds" and that collaboration between SOHMA and IC-
		ENC keeps growing every day more and more.</p>
		
		<p>Hasta pronto!</p>
