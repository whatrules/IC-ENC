		<p>“For me, it was very important to see and understand how the validation process is carried out” - <b>Hydrographic Institute of Portugal </b>​​</p>

		<Br>
		
		<p>​​​​​​​"Before attending the IC-ENC International ENC Validation training course in Panama, I was already validating ENCs regularly as part of my job. I believed that I had 
		a good understanding of the process, but I was unsure as to what I didn't know, and I was eager to learn more. I expected to receive a lot of information about IC-ENC 
		and their ENC Validation processes and procedures, but what I didn't expect was how much I would enjoy the experience.​ The course was an excellent mix of ENC Validation 
		theory and practical based learning exercises, skillfully taught by Mike Hawes. Mike's easygoing nature and good sense of humor helped transform highly technical material 
		into a fun learning experience. The practical based learning exercises were particularly enlightening. Real-world examples and problem solving exercises often resulted 
		in encouraged interaction between the fellow attendees from the various international hydrographic offices, leading to many informative discussions and the sharing of 
		technical expertise. This learning was further enhanced through various guest speakers and field trips highlighted by a behind-the-scenes look at the new Panal Canal 
		Locks. By the end of the course, I couldn't believe how quickly the two weeks passed. The course absolutely provided me with new insights, resources, and information 
		which I use on a daily basis when performing ENC production and validation tasks. I have attended many training seminars and courses throughout my career, including a few 
		multi-week training classes. All of these were helpful, and some were enjoyable, but the IC-ENC International ENC Validation training course was much more than I expected, 
		and it was thoroughly enjoyable, helpful and memorable!" - <b>Robert Ciepiela, Cartographer at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</b></p>

		<p>“The most useful parts of the course were being able to get to know the whole process of validation from start to finish, and meeting IC-ENC staff members and 
		representatives of other Hydrographic Office to exchange information and experiences amongst ourselves” ​- <b>Matija Klanscek, Cartographer at the Geodetic Institute 
		of Slovenia</b></p>

		<p>"I attended the IC-ENC International Validation Training Course  held at the AHS in Wollongong (May/June 2015). I found it an informative course and a great 2 weeks. 
		Before attending the course, I knew about IC-ENC and a basic knowledge of what they did. Through the course content and Mike's tutorage,  that changed.  We were informed
		of the what the various roles of IC-ENC  are and  the actual process IC-ENC follow on receiving an ENC from a member state before it is distributed. We also learnt 
		about some of the issues that the validators at IC-ENC see when comparing adjoining cells from different countries and how they encourage HOs to work together to help 
		create a seamless coverage of data. As part of the course, we got some hands on experience with the various programs that are used as part of the validation process. 
		This was great as the different HOs represented on the course didn't/don't all use the same programs. So this was great exposure. Nick (Ligacs) arranged for various people 
		from the AHS to talk to us which was great to hear there perspectives on where ENC have come from and where they see the future of nautical charting and ENCs going. The 
		two weeks weren't just the course work. We went for a variety of meals and excursions in and around Wollongong which all provided a great backdrop to talk not only about 
		the course and the work we do, but also to get to know each other better and form some lasting connections. For me this course not only left me more knowledgeable and 
		equipped in regards to ENCs, distribution  and use, but also provided a great opportunity to network with colleagues form various HOs and left me with great friendships 
		with people from several nations, and lasting memories. Thank you to all IC-ENC crew and all the participants on this course." - ​<b>Alison Cantrill, Cartographer at Land 
		Information New Zealand (LINZ)</b></p>

		<p>“I think it was a great idea to bring one member from each Hydrographic Office, as it allowed us to establish both social and working relationships. Please keep the 
		course in this format” ​- <b>South African Navy Hydrographic Office (SANHO)</b></p>

		<p>"An excellent course, suits from novice to confident validator level. It definitely improved my knowledge of how IC-ENC deals with ENC data, as well as my ability to 
		use validation tools and a better understanding of IC-ENC recommended actions for ENC improvement. Instruction was excellent and gave a lot of time to personal tuition
		and hands-on training. I would recommend this course to all HOs in need of ENC validation training for their staff. During the pilot course, the trainees were introduced 
		to the IC-ENC status, governance and financial framework, its roles and responsibilities, as well as its current and future technology. Basic background information and
		IHO documentation (including S-57 component documents – ENC Product Specification, Use of the Object Catalogue for ENC, Object/Attribute Catalogue) related to data 
		validation were presented, before the whole IC-ENC validation process (IC-ENC, 2013) was theoretically and practically demonstrated. Initially, the methodology and tools for 
		uploading/downloading of datasets exchanged between IC-ENC and HOs (Exchange Sets) was described, together with an overview of the applicable data flow/management scheme.</p>
		
		<p>Then, there were demonstrations of the ENC registration procedure and basic checks for data corruption, and non-sequential updates through the IC-ENC in-house developed 
		database and software. A series of checks according to the S-57 and S-58 (IHO, 2011) standards and specifications were exercised both in the classroom using dedicated 
		software suites (dKart Inspector, Editor and SevenCs' Analyzer, Designer, Optimiser, Manager), as well as at the IC-ENC facilities with cells being actually validated. 
		Variations from the S-57 and S-58 Standards (errors/warnings) are identified through the IC-ENC Errors Database/Lists and classified according to the impact to the mariner. 
		Data consistency checks between ENCs within a given region were also widely demonstrated. The trainees learnt how to assess data at the boundaries of adjoining ENCs that 
		have identical compilation scales and to assess data against larger and smaller-scaled ENCs which overlap it. The validation procedure continued with the utilisation of two 
		widely used ECDIS to ensure a safe representation of the chart data for the mariner through a clear, consistent and seamless ENC display. ECDIS are also used for 
		identification of issues related with the application of the SCAMIN attribute. </p>
		
		<p>Finally, issues related to ENC data gaps/holes, overlapping data, generalisation, vertex reduction, and the display of text files (.txt) and picture files (.tif) were 
		discussed through case studies. All error/warning messages (per processed ENC file) produced by the validation software together with any identified issues from the 
		validator's visual assessment, consistency and ECDIS checks are compiled in a comprehensive Validation Report which is sent to each IC-ENC member." ​- <b>Lt. Cdr. Panagiotis 
		Gkionis,  Hellenic Navy Hydrographic Service (HNHS)</b></p>

		<p>​"I am very pleased to have taken the lead in the development of the ENC Validation training course.  I have been involved with IC-ENC for a number of years now, 
		and it is great to have this opportunity for capacity building.  As a RENC, IC-ENC has now completed 70,000 validations, whilst also providing production support by 
		sharing its level of knowledge, experience and expertise with its members.  The course formalises this production support, providing each of our members a fantastic 
		opportunity to gain an enhanced understanding of ENC validation and quality assurance, as well as develop their knowledge of IC-ENC's working practices.  This will be 
		achieved through 12 modules, involving a variety of theory and practical based exercises, with plenty of opportunity for open discussion. The delivery of the pilot course 
		was very successful, and we received excellent feedback from the course delegates." - <b>Mike Hawes, IC-ENC Data Manager and Course Trainer</b></p>

		<p>"I am very excited about the new capacity building initiative from IC-ENC. The pilot course was a great success and I was proud to be able to present the graduation 
		certificates to the participants. Their feedback has lead to refinement in the course content, and so I am sure it will be of great benefit to the full range of personnel 
		at the IC-ENC members' ENC production departments, from new members of a team through to those with many years of ENC experience. The course has been designed with this 
		flexibility in mind.</p>
		
		<p>Another great benefit the course will bring is to build even stronger working relationships between the ENC production staff and the IC-ENC Validation team, and 
		between the staff from different nations. We are a community that strives to provide high quality ENCs to the mariner and strong working relationships can help us to 
		achieve this." - <b>James Harper, IC-ENC General Manager</b></p>
