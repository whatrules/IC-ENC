		  <a href="Blog Post 45.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><h6>New ENC coverage for the Panama Canal and Approaches</h6></a>
		  
		  <div class="news-card-author"><p>by Laura Tyzack at 09:45 in <a href="Catagories - Announcements.html" class="news-styling" style="text-decoration: none;">Announcements</a></p></div>
		  
		  <br>
		  
		  IC-ENC is pleased to announce that it has now formalised membership
		  arrangements with the Panama Canal Authority and Panama Maritime Authority,
		  both of which provide critical ENC coverage for international maritime trade.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  IC-ENC concluded membership arrangements with the Panama Maritime Authority
		  (PMA) early in 2015, and the first tranche of coverage was released in December
		  2015. PMA's responsibilities are to chart Panamanian water except for the areas
		  around and including the Canal. 
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  Subsequently, IC-ENC is pleased to announce that membership arrangements with
		  the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) have been finalised, and five new ENCs have
		  been released in this week's exchange set. These new ENCs cover the entire extent
		  of PCA's 'Area of Operation'. The IC-ENC Validation and Technical teams have
		  supported this production through detailed validation and quality assurance work.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The Panama Canal Expansion is the largest project since its original construction in
		  1914. The project will create a new lane of traffic along the Canal through the
		  construction of a new set of locks, doubling the waterway's capacity. The existing
		  locks allow the passage of vessels that can carry up to 5,000 TEUs. 
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The Program consists of several components:
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  New Locks (Third Set of Locks)
		  <br>
		  Pacific Access Channel
		  <br>
		  Improvement of Navigational Channels (Dredging)
		  <br>
		  Improvements to Water Supply
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The new locks are supported by new approach channels, including a 6.2km
		  channel at Miraflores. Each of these channels are 720ft wide, and after the
		  expansion, the Post-Panamax vessels will be able to transit through the Canal, with
		  up to 13,000/14,000 TEUs. The Expansion will double the Canal's capacity, having a
		  direct impact on economies of scale and international maritime trade. The new ENC
		  coverage provided by both authorities will support the new, wider, canal areas.

		  Its been another busy couple of months for IC-ENC. One of our main focuses has
		  been on the training of the four new international validation staff. These staff have
		  been based at IC-ENC HQ since the end of January to complete three months of IC-
		  ENC Validation and Regional Office training in preparation for when they start their
		  roles at the new IC-ENC Latin America and IC-ENC North America regional offices.
		  These two new regional offices are expected to be set up during 2016.

				We are pleased to confirm the IC-ENC Technical Conference (TC01) will be taking
				place from Wednesday 27th April to Friday 29th April 2016. The conference will be
				held at the Holiday Inn, Taunton, UK. 
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The Technical Conference will be an excellent opportunity for technical staff from all
				IC-ENC members' offices to meet and discuss any ENC production or data capture
				issues that they face. It will also be a great way to build working relationships and
				learn from colleagues with similar experiences in cartography and software usage.
				IC-ENC will also use this conference to take the opportunity to ensure all our
				members are aware of recent developments and the assistance that IC-ENC can
				provide.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Invitations have been sent via email, and we are looking forward to receiving your

				Welcome back! I hope you all had a lovely break, and you've come back feeling
				refreshed and ready for a 2016 full of fresh possibilities.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We are pleased to announce that 10 ENCs from the Panama Maritime Authority
				were released on 22nd December 2015 (week 52 exchange set). This is an exciting
				time for the Panama Maritime Authority, and we look forward to working with them
				further in due course.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We look forward to welcoming two delegates from NOAA, who will be the new IC-
				ENC North America Validators, at the end of January. We also look forward to
				welcoming back the two delegates from the Diretoria de Hidrografia e Navegação
				(DHN) in Brazil, who previously spent three weeks with us at IC-ENC HQ in
				November 2015. These four delegates will be spending three months at IC-ENC HQ
				on secondment in order to provide IC-ENC Validation and Regional Office training
				for when they start their roles at the new IC-ENC Latin America and IC-ENC North
				America regional offices.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				In addition, we will be welcoming a delegation from Venezuela to IC-ENC HQ
				from 7th - 16th March 2016. We look forward to spending time with the delegation to
				discuss ENC Production and ENC Validation matters.
				
				<br>

				We are currently in the process of organising the IC-ENC Technical Conference,
				which will be held in Taunton, UK during the week commencing 25th April 2016. The
				conference will run over the course of three days, with one main topic listed for
				discussion each day. These topics will include S-57, S-100 and S-101 and the IC-
				ENC Validation Service and Technology. The proposed format is:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Day 1: S-57:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				• Report from IHO ENC Working Group
				<br>
				• Sharing of best practice encoding techniques (recent changes)
				<br>
				• Changes and publication of S-58 version xx: what does this mean to the
				  encoder?
				<br>
				• Optional session: eGlobe ECDIS training (including installation process).
				  Applicable to those members who have not already received the software form
				  IC-ENC. This will complete the ECDIS roll out to all members
				 
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Day 2: S-100 & S-101:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				• Report from IHO S101 Working Group, including timeline
				<br>
				• Review of each member national position with respect to the new ENC
				standard. (A questionnaire will have been completed by each member prior to
				the Conference)
				<br>
				• Establish parameters for IC-ENC S-101 support to members
				<br>
				• Set plan for IC-ENC to develop the concept further to present to SC17

			With huge thanks to the IC-ENC Technical Team and the Novo systems support
			team, we are happy to announce that the migration to the cloud environment has
			been a success, and we have now been working on our new operating systems for
			a month. The next stage is to enable IC-ENC Australia to gain access to the IC-ENC
			cloud environment, allowing the two offices to operate more efficiently with one
			another. Both IC-ENC Latin America and IC-ENC North America will follow in 2016.

			<br>
			<br>
			
			This month, we had inbound visits from Egypt and Malta. It was a great
			opportunity to spend some time with both delegations discussing IC-ENC's ENC
			production and validation services. 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Last week, we attended a talk held by Rachel Medley from the National Oceanic
			and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This was a great opportunity to learn more
			about the different divisions within NOAA, and a result we are really excited for the
			development and launch of IC-ENC North America, and our working partnership
			with NOAA to go forward in 2016.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We currently have two delegates from the Diretoria de Hidrografia e Navegação
			(DHN) in Brazil at IC-ENC HQ for a three week secondment. The aim of this
			secondment is to provide IC-ENC Validation training for the two delegates, who will
			be working in the IC-ENC Latin America office once it is launched in early 2016. The
			two delegates will be spending their time at IC-ENC HQ learning about all of IC-
			ENC's operating processes, particularly the ENC Validation processes which they
			will be performing back in the IC-ENC Latin America office.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We continue to experience a high validation workload, with average weekly
			exchange sets of 160 ENCs.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			IC-ENC will remain open throughout the Christmas period, and we will respond to
			email queries as quickly as possible during this time. The calendar below shows
			which days the IC-ENC UK office will be open:

				IC-ENC is excited to announce the release of the first Slovenian ENC, produced by
				the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia.  This ENC will be released to the IC-ENC VARs
				for distribution on 6th November 2015.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Although the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia started the production of ENCs a few
				years ago, and completed a substantial amount of work, they were unable to
				validate it properly and issue ENCs formally without being a member of a RENC.
				Since joining IC-ENC in July 2014 as IC-ENC's 31st member nation, the Geodetic
				Institute of Slovenia has benefited from IC-ENC's full support to develop its in-house
				ENC production capacity through IC-ENC's Independent ENC Validation, Production
				Support and Capacity Building (training) services.  IC-ENC prides itself on the
				provision of assistance to its members, regardless of when they joined or their ENC
				production capability. IC-ENC's ENC Production services include direct contact with the
				IC-ENC Validation Team via email, telephone and Skype.  The IC-ENC
				Validation Team strive to provide timely responses to any issues, queries or general
				feedback from members.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Above all, the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia has greatly benefitted from attending
				IC-ENC's International ENC Validation Training Course.  Matija Klanjšček,
				Cartographer, attended the training course in February 2015, along with nine other
				delegates from different Hydrographic Offices.  Matija thoroughly enjoyed the
				training opportunity, highlighting that he has noticed significant improvements to his
				understanding of ENC production and ENC validation processes. He also
				emphasized how great it was to meet the IC-ENC staff and representatives of other
				Hydrographic Offices to exchange information and experiences.  As a result, he was
				more than happy to present his feedback to the IC-ENC Steering Committee during
				this year's meeting held back in September.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC has delivered three International ENC Validation training courses during
				2015, held in Taunton (UK), Wollongong (Australia) and Panama (Central America).
				The training course provides its members with the knowledge and skills required to
				perform data validation at their home ENC production offices.  The training course
				runs for a period of two weeks, and runs through the entire ENC Validation process
				from start to finish, as well as providing an overview of IC-ENC's additional three
				core services:  ENC production support, ENC distribution and ENC revenue
				management. One specific element of the course is designed to enable each user to
				gain the maximum benefit from the ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS, which IC-ENC
				has selected as a tool to provide its 38 member nations with to supplement ENC
				production and validation processes.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC will be holding three further training courses in 2016.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Following the release of the first ENC, the Port of Koper (Band 5), Slovenia plan to
				continue with ENC production covering the wider area of Bay of Koper (Band 4),
				and eventually covering the whole territorial waters of the Republic of Slovenia with
				another ENC of a smaller scale.

			    A shorter update this month, but I will start with some good news!
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We are excited to announce the release of the first Slovenian ENC; a great
				achievement for the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia. This ENC will be released on 6th
				November 2015.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC prides itself on the provision of assistance to its members, regardless of
				when they joined or the extent of their ENC production capability. It is fantastic to
				see how well the ENC production staff at the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia have
				benefited from IC-ENC's Independent ENC Validation and ENC Production Support
				services, as well as IC-ENC's International ENC Validation Training Course. As part
				of their production plan, the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia intend to release a further
				4 ENCs during 2016.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				James has just returned from the PRIMAR Advisory Committee (PAC) meeting in
				Paris, where he was briefed on PRIMAR's developments over the past year. As
				agreed at the last Steering Committee (SC16), the Open Sessions will now cease.
				Instead, a series of more regular meetings will take place between the Chairs and
				Management of IC-ENC and PRIMAR, with written reports submitted following each
				PAC and SC meeting.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We also had a visit from the Turkish Hydrographic Office last week to discuss the
				next Steering Committee meeting, which Turkey has kindly offered to host, as well
				as to spend some time with the team at IC-ENC HQ.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Richard Northover, IC-ENC Commercial Manager, has finished preparing the Q3
				sales reports and new ENC wholesale pricing list, both of which will be distributed to
				members imminently.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The IC-ENC Technical Team have been very busy working on the new technology
				developments, and carrying out various forms of testing to ensure that the systems
				are ready to be implemented. This is an exciting time for IC-ENC as we migrate to a
				Cloud-based working environment, whilst facilitating consistency between all IC-
				ENC regional offices, and the growth of IC-ENC as a whole.
