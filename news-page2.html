		The South Pacific island chain of Vanuatu was devastated on March 13th by
		Cyclone Pam.  This event is now regarded as one of the most severe tropical
		cyclone disasters in the history of Vanuatu, and has resulted in the tragic loss of 16
		lives.  The majority of the damage is at the capital of Port Vila, although other parts
		of the 65 inhabited islands have also been affected by the natural disaster.  The
		United Nations have confirmed that humanitarian aid has been delivered to all of the
		affected islands of the country, providing food packages and water for more than
		166,000 people, however,  this important work will continue for as long as necessary
		in support of the affected communities. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO), which is the primary charting
		authority for Vanuatu, has decided to rapidly issue new editions of two Vanuatu ENC
		cells in response to the disaster.  These new editions, GB501638 Northern Vanuatu
		- Espiritu Santo - Luganville and GB501494 Port Vila are to be distributed through
		IC-ENC on a free of charge basis for use by all interested parties and to assist with
		the humanitarian relief effort. At the first opportunity, these cells will be included
		within the weekly exchange set to the IC-ENC Value Added Reseller (VAR) network.
		They will also be available to download on the IC-ENC website by clicking here.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Both IC-ENC and UKHO are pleased to be able to support the international
		community at this challenging time.

		<div class="news-card-author"><p>by Laura Tyzack at 14:00 in <a href="Catagories - Announcements.html" class="news-styling" style="text-decoration: none;">Announcements</a></p></div>

		<br>

		​Sadly, I must inform you that Lieutenant Marcelo Olivera has now left his position as
		Head of Cartography of SOHMA (Hydrographic Office of Uruguay). I speak on
		behalf of the whole IC-ENC team when I say that it has always been a pleasure to
		work with Marcelo. His enthusiastic and friendly emails were always well received,
		displaying a close working relationship with the whole team, even though a couple
		of us have never had the opportunity to meet him face-to-face!  
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Marcelo first joined the Naval Academy of his country in 2001, getting his degree in
		2004. After two years integrating the crews of Sailing Ships of Uruguay and Mexico
		(including a trip around the world of 10 months in the latter), he was assigned to the
		Hydrographic Ship ROU22 "Oyarvide" in 2007. Between 2008 and 2009 he made
		his specialization in Hydrography at the Postgraduate School of the Venezuelan
		Navy and in the last five years, he has served as Head of Cartography Branch in
		SOHMA, Uruguay. Here, he worked closely with IC-ENC in order to improve both
		the quality and availability of cartographic products of his country.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Today, Marcelo will be rejoining the Hydrographic Ship ROU22 'Oyarvide', which he
		was previously assigned to, as Head of Surveys and Operations.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Marcelo has kindly provided us with a few words that he would like to share to the
		IC-ENC community:
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		"My arrival at the Hydrographic Office of Uruguay, and my assignment as Head of
		the Cartography Branch in 2010 coincided with the signing of the agreement
		between SOHMA and IC-ENC and the first steps on the path to integration to the
		aforementioned RENC. By then, the challenge was great and of course we do not
		have any previous experience that supports us.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The process took some time, in which the 'Joining Instructions' were an extremely
		valuable tool for guidance and orientation. Furthermore, at this stage the patience
		and support that each of the members of the IC-ENC had with us, assisting and
		advising us in the process of designing an ENC that meets the standards of
		validation was invaluable. In January 2012, exactly one year after the delivery of our
		first batch of cells, they were approved, starting their distribution.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		My experience over the years working with the IC-ENC is that human warmth and
		generous disposition of each of its members, makes contact to be very close. It
		could be defined as a "group of friends at a distance" which often do not know each
		other in person, but let your work with ENCs to be a pleasant and enjoyable
		experience.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Now that I am leaving Cartography Branch in order to take on a new challenge in
		my naval career, SOHMA has reached 27 cells distributed worldwide through the
		RENC, with at least 15 additional cells in preparation for this 2015. I would like
		express my deep appreciation to the staff of IC-ENC for all the learning and
		experience they have shared with me over the years and the staff of the Electronic
		Cartography Division of SOHMA, by the tireless effort of preparing products which
		matches the greater level of world requirement.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		I wish you all "fair winds" and that collaboration between SOHMA and IC-ENC
		keeps growing every day more and more.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Hasta pronto!"

		It's been a busy month down here in IC-ENC. In addition to hosting our first training
		course of 2015, we have also had a sharp rise in the amount of incoming data which
		has kept the validation team occupied (to say the least!), as well as several
		meetings and visits.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Following on from the first week of the training course, the delegates spent the
		weekend exploring the local area. On Saturday, a few of the delegates spent the
		day in Bath, and on Sunday, IC-ENC organised a day trip down to Lyme Regis, a
		small seaside town on the South coast of England. Luckily it was a lovely sunny day
		(the past few days it had been pouring with rain!), so the delegates were able to
		make the most of it. We also organised a couple of evenings during the two week
		period for the team and the delegates to relax and enjoy a friendly drink together.

		Some of the topics covered in the second week included data consistency, where
		the delegates were able to discuss their views on the use of SCAMIN and the
		problems associated with overlapping data in detail, as well as the distribution of
		data where the delegates learnt about S-63 (Data Protection Scheme) and the route
		to the market place via the IC-ENC VARs. In addition, the delegates had the
		opportunity to get hands on with the Transas ECDIS, helping them to put some of
		their learning into practice.

		On the data front, we are pleased to announce that the first 17 Philippines cells sent
		to IC-ENC were released to the market place for distribution by our VARs on 27th
		February 2015. As of week 10, this addition brings our total number of issued ENCs
		to 5,500!

		Richard Fowle, IC-ENC Technical Manager, attended the Joint TSMAD29 and
		DIPWG7 meeting which was held in Ottawa, Canada from 2nd-6th February. The
		meeting was well attended by both Hydrographic Offices and Industries. Individual
		reports were given to the meeting group regarding the activities of other IHO
		Working Groups and organisations, and as a result there were some good
		discussions surrounding the topics of S-58, S-100 and S-101. Some of the main
		outcomes of the meeting were the further developments regarding S-101, and the
		restructuring of TSMAD and DIPWG, which have now been replaced by the S-
		100WG and ENCWG. If you are interested in finding out more about the Joint
		TSMAD29 and DIPWG7 meeting, the minutes will be available on the IHB website
		in the near future. In addition, more information on the new S-100WG and ENCWG
		can be found on the IHO website.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		James attended the 6th RSAHC meeting in Abu Dhabi, which took place from 9th-
		11th February. James presented on IC-ENC services, with a particular focus on
		capacity building and our first training course of 2015. The presentation was well
		received, and some interesting questions were asked. Additionally, James met
		several new contacts from our existing members Pakistan and Bahrain, and
		continued to develop IC-ENC's relationship with several prospective new members.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		On 27th February, We had a visit from Commander Nickolás Roscher, Directorate of
		Hydrography and Navigation at the Brazilian HO (DHN). Nickolás spent the day with
		the team, learning about our core services and some of the main processes we
		perform on a daily basis. We believe that visits such as these provide a
		great opportunity to develop and strengthen our working relationships with one
		another.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		James and Mathias have also just attended the 5th WENDWG meeting, which was
		held in Singapore from 3rd – 5th March. At the meeting, James presented a RENC
		progress report, based on the 2014 Annual Report, which was well received by the
		group and sparked some interesting discussions. The main topics of discussion
		included the issues surrounding overlapping data, and the method of assessing
		progress on delivering adequate ENC coverage to support the mandation of ECDIS,
		the IHO ENC catalogue, and the S-101 future standard. As a direct result of this
		meeting, IC-ENC will be collaborating with the Maritime and Port Authority of
		Singapore (MPA) in order to investigate the effects of overlapping ENCs on various
		types of ECDIS, including both behaviour and display of data.

		James Harper, IC-ENC Manager, and Mathias Jonas, IC-ENC Chairman both
		attended the 5th IHO WENDWG meeting, which was held in Singapore from 3rd-5th
		March. 

		<br>
		<br>
		
		The WENDWG (Worldwide ENC Database Working Group) is an IHO group, and
		subsidiary of the Inter Regional Coordination Committee (IRCC) which is
		responsible for advising the IRCC on the development and monitoring of the
		principles, guidelines and governance surrounding the WEND. As a result, the
		WENDWG aims to facilitate a worldwide consistent level of high quality, updated
		official ENCs through integrated services that support SOLAS carriage requirements
		and the IMO Performance Standards for ECDIS.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		At the meeting, IC-ENC presented a RENC progress report, based on the 2014
		Annual Report, which was well received by the group, and as a result sparked some
		good discussions. The main topics of discussions included the problems and
		solutions to overlapping ENCs, and the method of assessing progress on delivering

		Firstly, thank you for all of your positive comments on the first blog post; I'm so glad
		that you enjoyed reading it. As a result, I'm back with blog number two!
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC is now half way through the first training course of 2015, which is being held
		here in Taunton for a two week period from 2nd – 13th February.  Eleven delegates
		were selected to attend the course from various different regions of the world:
		Belgium, Egypt, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, South
		Africa, and Spain.  So far, the delegates have been learning about IC-ENC's roles
		and responsibilities, as well as its core processes such as how we download and
		register data from our members.

		<br>
		<br>
		
		The training course aims to provide the knowledge and skills required to carry out
		the various aspects of ENC Validation back at their home offices.  In addition,
		delegates will be able to demonstrate an understanding of IC-ENC, the relevant
		international standards, and the content and construction of ENCs by validating
		ENC data and investigating the reported errors.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		We also intend for our training courses to bring our members together to share
		ideas and build strong working relationships with one another, therefore showing us
		as a truly international organisation.  In addition, the delegates also have the
		opportunity to meet and build working relationships with the team at the IC-ENC UK
		office.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		There will be two more training courses delivered during 2015, one in Latin America
		and one in Australia.  If you are interested in attending one of our training courses,
		please see the IC-ENC website or contact Mike Hawes (Course Instructor) at
		mike.hawes@ic-enc.org for more information.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		We have also enjoyed a visit from Dr Mathias Jonas, IC-ENC Chairman, to the IC-
		ENC HQ office in Taunton on 5th February.  Mathias was introduced to the course
		delegates before spending the rest of the day with the each member of the IC-ENC
		team to gain a full understanding of all the services IC-ENC provides, as well as
		some of the current project work that each team member is working on.

		On the data front, IC-ENC has now released all of the Italian ENCs to the market
		place for distribution by our VARs.  As a result, 253 additional ENCs have been
		added to our catalogue, which brings our total number of issued ENCs to 5,473!

		This month also saw the release of Real Time Reporting (RTR), the new IC-ENC
		business system, which has been one of Richard Northover's main projects since he
		joined as IC-ENC Commercial Manager in March 2014.  The main features of the
		system include automated XML based sales orders, from VARs, submitted on a 24
		hour basis via email, fully automated sales order processing, immediate automated
		VAR receipts or error reports via email, and automated monthly VAR invoicing.  This
		new system will provide immediate benefits including a robust, streamlined and
		automated sales order process for both the VARs and IC-ENC with the elimination
		of manually induced errors. In addition, RTR will provide the ability to customise
		reporting for members on far more elements than has previously been possible.

		Further afield, James will be attending the 6th Meeting of the RSAHC, which will be
		held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 9th – 11th February. James will be
		there to meet with current and potential members, so please do go and introduce
		yourself if you are also attending.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Looking ahead to September, IC-ENC is pleased to announce that this year's
		Steering Committee Meeting will be held in Munich from 7th – 8th September. The
		meeting will be held at the Holiday Inn Munich – City Centre hotel. All invitations
		were sent out on Friday 23rd January, so please make every effort to respond by
		Monday 16th February, and if you have any questions please contact me at
		laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org.

		Now we're already a few weeks into the New Year, we thought it would be a great
		opportunity to give a round up on last year's achievements. There is no doubt that
		2014 has been a busy year for IC-ENC, but we have a lot to show for it. From
		welcoming six new members, to launching our ENC Validation training course,
		we've been kept on our toes at all times.  
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		2014 has seen a dramatic increase in membership, and IC-ENC welcomes
		Suriname, The Philippines, Slovenia, Italy, Egypt and Malaysia to our family of
		members, bringing the total number of IC-ENC members to 34. All of these nations
		will provide important coverage for the IC-ENC ENC folio, and we are now working
		to incorporate all of the ENCs into our database.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		As part of a capacity building initiative, IC-ENC successfully launched its ENC
		Validation training course in March, delivering the pilot course to three delegates:
		two from Greece and one from the Netherlands. The pilot course was a huge
		success, and as a result there will be three courses delivered throughout 2015.

		We had another successful Steering Committee meeting in September, which saw
		the highest number of participants to date. It was great to have so many of our
		member nations together to discuss issues and ideas, and set the strategic direction
		for the year ahead. The end of the meeting saw IC-ENC Chairman Capt. Peter
		Kortenoeven complete his two year tenure, followed by the election and
		appointment of the new IC-ENC Chairman, Dr. Mathias Jonas, and two Vice
		Chairmen, Jens Peter Hartmann and Cdr. Ricardo Lopez Cruz. Capt. Peter
		Kortenoeven, and his family, have since temporarily moved to Ethiopia to embrace
		the African way of life.

		In addition to the Steering Committee, IC-ENC has also attended various
		Hydrographic commissions and conferences throughout the year. In particular, IC-
		ENC attended the Extraordinary International Hydrographic Conference (EIHC) in
		October. This was an excellent opportunity to represent IC-ENC globally and to
		promote the service which we provide, whilst working in harmony with our RENC
		colleagues from PRIMAR. Additionally, it was great to see so many of you there
		visiting our exhibition stand.

		A little closer to home at the IC-ENC UK office, Richard Northover was appointed as
		IC-ENC Commercial Manager in March. Richard has been focused on ENC
		licensing considerations and Real Time Reporting, amongst other commercial
		responsibilities.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Whilst down under at the IC-ENC Australia office, the team has continued to provide
		a high level of support to both the local region and to us here at the IC-ENC UK
		office with their frequent ideas and suggestions to improve the service that IC-ENC
		provides.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Looking to the year ahead, we are excited to continue delivering and improving our
		service for our members. We look forward to delivering the first training course of
		2015 in February here in Taunton to eleven delegates from Europe and beyond.
		Further courses will follow in Australia and Latin America. Not only does the course
		emphasise our dedication towards capacity building, but it also shows our
		enthusiasm to pass on our ENC expertise to our members, with the anticipated
		result of creating and managing a more seamless ENC folio, all for the benefit of the
		mariner.
