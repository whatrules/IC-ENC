		<br>

		IC-ENC has selected the new ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS as a tool to provide
		their 37 member nations with to supplement ENC production and validation
		processes.  This will give each member Hydrographic Office the opportunity to load
		their ENCs into an ECDIS in order that the maritime user's perspective can be
		considered and to check its interoperability with adjacent data.  
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The SevenCs display engine inside the ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS is used by
		30% of all ECDIS and ECS users within the SOLAS market, allowing IC-ENC and its
		members to make a representative data assessment on a user friendly ECDIS,
		whilst following the latest performance standards.  The ChartWorld eGlobe G2
		ECDIS software will be supplied to those member nations following attendance on
		IC-ENC's International ENC Validation training course.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC has delivered three International ENC Validation training courses this year,
		each held in a different part of the world. The first training course was held in
		Taunton, UK, in February 2015.  The second was held in Wollongong, Australia, in
		May, and the third course has just been delivered in Panama, Central America
		during September.  The course provides its members with the knowledge and skills
		required to perform data validation at their home ENC production offices.  The
		training course runs for a period of two weeks, and runs through the entire ENC
		Validation process from start to finish, as well as providing an overview of IC-ENC's
		additional three core services:  ENC production support, ENC distribution and ENC
		revenue management.  One specific element of the course is designed to enable
		each user to gain the maximum benefit from the ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The Slovenian Hydrographic Office commented: "The most useful parts of the
		course were being able to get to know the whole process of validation from start to
		finish, and meeting IC-ENC staff members and representatives of other
		Hydrographic Office to exchange information and experiences amongst ourselves".
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC will be holding three further training courses in 2016, for which a further
		ECDIS delivery schedule plan will be implemented.

	Mike Hawes, IC-ENC Course Trainer/Data Manager has just delivered the third and
	final IC-ENC ENC Validation Training Course of 2015 (bronze level). The course
	was held in Panama for a period of two weeks, from 14th – 25th September. The
	course was delivered to 18 delegates from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba,
	Ecuador, Panama Canal Authority, Panama Maritime Authority, Peru, Suriname,
	Uruguay, United States, and Venezuela.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	On behalf of the whole IC-ENC team, I'd like to say a big thank you to the Panama
	Canal Authority, in particular Jaime Rodriguez, for offering IC-ENC their training
	facilities to host the training course.

	We are excited to announce our latest IC-ENC member developments: Israel, Oman
	and NOAA (US). The Survey of Israel (SOI) joined as our 36th member in August.
	We will be working with SOI to develop its in-house production capabilities in order
	to assist in the production and maintenance of their ENC data. The Oman National
	Hydrographic Office (ONHO) joined as our 37th member during the Steering
	Committee meeting. ONHO currently has seven ENCs, and IC-ENC will provide
	further support in order to assist the development of its in-house ENC production
	capabilities. In addition, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
	(NOAA) have entered into the initial phase of becoming our 38th member. This
	decision was reached following the Steering Committee's endorsement of the
	proposal to establish a fourth IC-ENC regional office in Washington, DC, USA, as
	well as the approval of NOAA's intended membership. The membership
	arrangements and inclusion of the new office into IC-ENC's global operating
	framework are now subject to further analysis and development by both the NOAA
	and IC-ENC teams. Further announcements will be made in due course.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Lastly, whilst we're on the subject of IC-ENC regional offices, I thought I'd take this
	opportunity to update you all on the progress being made at the IC-ENC Latin
	America regional office in Niteroi, Brazil. The office accommodation has now been
	established, and the appointed staff members are now working in the office and
	taking part in regular online meetings with IC-ENC HQ. The two appointed Data
	Validators have just completed the bronze level training course in Panama, and
	formal gold level training is planned to be held in Taunton at a later date.

		IC-ENC is proud to announce that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
		Administration (NOAA) have entered into the initial phase of becoming the 38th
		national hydrographic office to join its rapidly increasing family of members.   
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The 2015 IC-ENC annual Steering Committee meeting in Munich, Germany
		approved NOAA's intended membership of IC-ENC and endorsed a proposal for
		NOAA and IC-ENC to establish a fourth regional office of IC-ENC in Washington, 
		DC, USA. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The membership arrangements, and the inclusion of the new office into IC-ENC's
		global operating framework, are now subject to detailed analysis and development
		by the NOAA and IC-ENC teams.  Further announcements will follow as the IC-ENC
		North America office develops full operating capability during 2016. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		NOAA currently produces and maintains over 1000 ENCs.  IC-ENC's Production
		Support including Capacity Building (Training) and Independent Validation services
		will be delivered to NOAA via the IC-ENC North America office.  The NOAA ENCs
		will form part of the global IC-ENC folio, and be included in IC-ENC's ENC
		Distribution service, achieved through the main IC-ENC office in the UK, 

		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC is looking forward to working in partnership with NOAA and assisting in
		sustaining this important ENC coverage.

	IC-ENC is excited to announce that the Egyptian Naval Hydrographic Department
	(ENHD) have produced their first 12 ENCs (10 Harbour and 2 Approach), which
	seamlessly cover the waters of the Suez Canal. IC-ENC has been working closely
	with ENHD to assist in the production of these new ENCs, both through attendance
	of the IC-ENC ENC Validation Training Course in February 2015, and through
	telephone and email support on a regular basis.

	ENHD have also been working in partnership with the Suez Canal Authority (SCA)
	to ensure that the release of these new ENCs align with the opening of the new and
	important 35km second channel within the Suez Canal on 6th August 2015. These
	ENCs will provide flexibility and usability at different scales throughout the whole
	canal.

	The official opening took place at 15:00 local time on 6th August, which saw El
	Horreya, a Royal Egyptian yacht, take the first transit from south to north using the
	new channel. In the evening there was a performance of Aida, an opera written by
	Guiseppe Verdi, which was also performed at the original opening of the Suez Canal
	in 1869.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	This is the greatest expansion of the canal since it first opened in 1869, costing $8
	billion. The works involved 12 months of dredging using 45 dredgers, which has
	resulted in the removal of approximately 250 million cubic meters of soil. Previously
	a single lane, the canal can now facilitate traffic in two directions in almost 45% of its
	length, thus reducing transit time from 18 hours to 11 hours. As a result, waiting
	times have been minimised to just three hours, allowing the transit of 45 vessels in
	two directions, and increasing the maximum permissible vessel draft to 66ft
	throughout the canal.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	With the daily average of transiting vessels expected to double, this important
	expansion of the Suez Canal will help to support and enhance increasing world
	trade.

	It's been another busy month for IC-ENC, with new staff members,
	various international meetings and visits, Steering Committee preparations, and no
	let up on the data front. 
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	IC-ENC attended two Hydrographic Commissions this month. James attended the
	Mediterranean and Black Sea Hydrographic Commission meeting (MBSHC), held in
	Batumi, Georgia from 29th June - 2nd July. It was a productive meeting with good
	discussions regarding ENHD and IC-ENC's combined efforts on ENC production in
	the Suez Canal, and ENC scheming in the general area.

	<br>
	<br>
	
	Subsequently, Richard Fowle attended the South East Pacific Hydrographic
	Commission meeting (SEPHC), held in Guayaquil, Ecuador from 13th – 16th July.
	Richard updated the commission on IC-ENC's capacity building initiatives, including
	the IC-ENC International Validation training course, and also on IC-ENC's revised
	policy regarding overlapping data and areas of responsibility. Richard also spent
	some time discussing new ENC production plans with Ecuador.

	Dan Garratt, IC-ENC Data Validator, has recently gained promotion to IC-ENC
	Senior Data Validator following a successful interview. The main objectives of the
	IC-ENC Senior Data Validator role are to maintain the IC-ENC documentation which
	underpins the IC-ENC Production Support and ENC Validation services; carry out
	IC-ENC Production Support and Validation services when required; to achieve and
	maintain ISO9001 quality management certification for all IC-ENC operations across
	all IC-ENC offices; and to develop the culture of customer focus and continual
	improvement across the IC-ENC organisation.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	This month, we also held a secondment for Gailen Helga Pietersen, an employee of
	the South African Navy Hydrographic Office (SANHO), from 6th – 10th July. Gailen
	spent her the first part of the week with Mike, IC-ENC Data Manager/IC-ENC
	Course Instructor, in order to familiarise her with IC-ENC's core services. Gailen
	then spent time with each member of the Validation team, who took her through the
	entire Validation process.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	We were pleased to welcome Scott Drayton, our new IC-ENC Assistant Technical
	Manager, to the team on 20th July. Scott will be working in IC-ENC for a contracted
	period of 12 months to deliver improvements to IC-ENC services and information
	technology as defined in IC-ENC's Target Operating Model.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	We were also delighted to welcome Dr. Mathias Jonas, IC-ENC Chairman and
	Hydrographer of the German Hydrographic Office (BSH), to IC-ENC HQ on Tuesday
	28th July. Mathias spent the day discussing some of the agenda topics for the fast
	approaching Steering Committee16 meeting. In addition, Mathias was briefed on
	some of the ongoing projects within IC-ENC by individual members of the team.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Steering Committee 16 is approaching swiftly, and IC-ENC is currently working on
	the discussion papers for the meeting. All discussion papers will be circulated one
	month before the meeting takes place to allow delegates to familiarise themselves
	with the topics listed for discussion in the agenda. If you have not yet replied to your
	invitation, but you would like to attend, please send your travel form to me as soon
	as possible on laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Shortly after Steering Committee 16, our third and final IC-ENC International
	Validation training course of 2015 will be taking place in Panama from 14th – 25th
	September. Mike, IC-ENC Course Instructor/IC-ENC Data Manager, is currently
	working hard to ensure all of the final arrangements for the course are under way for
	the 15 delegates who will be attending the training course in September.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Lastly, we are sad to inform you that Sidney Osborne has recently announced
	his retirement from his post at the South African Hydrographic Office (SANHO). We
	have been in correspondence with Sidney since IC-ENC was set up in 2002, with
	South Africa being one of IC-ENC's first members. Below are a few words from
	Sidney himself:
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	"IC-ENC and the South African Hydrographic Office have had a long and very fruitful
	relationship over the years, so I certainly will reflect warmly on the great times I've
	had with many of the IC-ENC members, past and present here in South Africa and
	abroad. Without singling out any members at IC-ENC, I would like to convey my
	best wishes to all who may remember me, and I hope they continue to enjoy their
	careers in the unique world of ENCs and IC-ENC. I am also that sure those who
	follow in my footsteps in the SANHO will also discover and experience first hand the
	good cordial manner in which IC-ENC provides the valuable service to its
	members".

	Some of you may have already seen and read the news announcement on the
	website regarding the development of a new regional office in Brazil, to be known as
	IC-ENC Latin America. This new office will be developed in partnership with the
	Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN), and will be located in the Niteroi
	offices of DHN, near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The initiative was approved by the IC-
	ENC Steering Committee following the near-unanimous results of a vote, and
	now IC-ENC and DHN will begin to develop the new regional office in line with the
	approved business case.
	
	<br>

	Mike has now settled back into the team after hosting the IC-ENC International
	Validation training course, which was held in Wollongong, Australia, from 25th May
	until 5th July. The course was a great success, with even more working
	relationships built and knowledge shared between nations. It was also a good
	opportunity to work closely with the IC-ENC Australia team, and in addition ex-IC-
	ENC Chairman, Rod Nairn, was there to present the certificates to the delegates at
	the end of the course.

	James visited the offices of NOAA to discuss ENC production and validation
	concepts, before moving on to Mexico City to represent IC-ENC at the IHO’s IRCC7
	meeting. WEND matters were discussed and James also formally announced IC-
	ENC's decision to launch the new regional office in Latin America. James then
	travelled to Panama City to visit the two ENC producing organizations. James
	visited the Panama Maritime Authority, who recently joined IC-ENC,
	to provide guidance on the next stages of ENC production. He then met with the IC-
	ENC contacts within the Panama Canal Authority, where he was shown the training
	facilities which have been made available for IC-ENC to deliver its International
	Validation training course in September. Following the return from this trip, James
	will be working towards the upcoming MBSHC meeting, which is to be held in
	Georgia between 30th June and 2nd July. He will then be concentrating on the
	preparation of discussion papers for Steering Committee 16 in September.

	Last week's exchange set, on 26th June, was the largest exchange set of data that
	IC-ENC has ever validated and released. The exchange set contains a total of 269
	files, including 226 updates, 41 new editions, and 2 new cells. This brings the total
	number of ENCs released by IC-ENC to 5,619. This is a stark contrast to last year,
	when the average number of ENC files issued per week was 131. A big well done to
	the team for their efforts!
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	As part of Kevin's last day in IC-ENC, we had a team building day out at Go
	Segway. For those of you who are not familiar with a segway, it is a two-wheeled,
	self-balancing, electric powered vehicle, and is the latest
	trend in 'green' transportation. During our segway safari tour, we took on obstacles,
	hills and sharp turns, and it quickly became apparent who was (and who was not!) a
	natural segway master. All in all, it was a great experience, and it was a good
	opportunity for the team to relax, enjoy themselves, and have a good laugh together.
