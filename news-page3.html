		IC-ENC welcomes Survey of Israel (SOI), which has become the 36th national
		Hydrographic Office to join the rapidly increasing family of members. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		SOI currently has one ENC, and IC-ENC intends to provide close support in order to
		assist and develop its in-house ENC production capacity. This will be achieved
		through IC-ENC's Production Support, Independent Validation and Capacity Building
		(Training) services.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC is looking forward to working in partnership with SOI and assisting in the
		development of this important ENC coverage.

	IC-ENC is excited to announce that the Egyptian Naval Hydrographic Department
	(ENHD) have produced their first 12 ENCs (10 Harbour and 2 Approach), which
	seamlessly cover the waters of the Suez Canal. IC-ENC has been working closely
	with ENHD to assist in the production of these new ENCs, both through attendance
	of the IC-ENC ENC Validation Training Course in February 2015, and through
	telephone and email support on a regular basis.

	ENHD have also been working in partnership with the Suez Canal Authority (SCA)
	to ensure that the release of these new ENCs align with the opening of the new and
	important 35km second channel within the Suez Canal on 6th August 2015. These
	ENCs will provide flexibility and usability at different scales throughout the whole
	canal.

	<br>
	<br>
	
	The official opening took place at 15:00 local time on 6th August, which saw El
	Horreya, a Royal Egyptian yacht, take the first transit from south to north using the
	new channel. In the evening there was a performance of Aida, an opera written by
	Guiseppe Verdi, which was also performed at the original opening of the Suez Canal
	in 1869.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	This is the greatest expansion of the canal since it first opened in 1869, costing $8
	billion. The works involved 12 months of dredging using 45 dredgers, which has
	resulted in the removal of approximately 250 million cubic meters of soil. Previously
	a single lane, the canal can now facilitate traffic in two directions in almost 45% of its
	length, thus reducing transit time from 18 hours to 11 hours. As a result, waiting
	times have been minimised to just three hours, allowing the transit of 45 vessels in
	two directions, and increasing the maximum permissible vessel draft to 66ft
	throughout the canal.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	With the daily average of transiting vessels expected to double, this important
	expansion of the Suez Canal will help to support and enhance increasing world
	trade.

	It's been another busy month for IC-ENC, with new staff members,
	various international meetings and visits, Steering Committee preparations, and no
	let up on the data front. 
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	IC-ENC attended two Hydrographic Commissions this month. James attended the
	Mediterranean and Black Sea Hydrographic Commission meeting (MBSHC), held in
	Batumi, Georgia from 29th June - 2nd July. It was a productive meeting with good
	discussions regarding ENHD and IC-ENC's combined efforts on ENC production in
	the Suez Canal, and ENC scheming in the general area.

	Subsequently, Richard Fowle attended the South East Pacific Hydrographic
	Commission meeting (SEPHC), held in Guayaquil, Ecuador from 13th – 16th July.
	Richard updated the commission on IC-ENC's capacity building initiatives, including
	the IC-ENC International Validation training course, and also on IC-ENC's revised
	policy regarding overlapping data and areas of responsibility. Richard also spent
	some time discussing new ENC production plans with Ecuador.

	Dan Garratt, IC-ENC Data Validator, has recently gained promotion to IC-ENC
	Senior Data Validator following a successful interview. The main objectives of the
	IC-ENC Senior Data Validator role are to maintain the IC-ENC documentation which
	underpins the IC-ENC Production Support and ENC Validation services; carry out
	IC-ENC Production Support and Validation services when required; to achieve and
	maintain ISO9001 quality management certification for all IC-ENC operations across
	all IC-ENC offices; and to develop the culture of customer focus and continual
	improvement across the IC-ENC organisation.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	This month, we also held a secondment for Gailen Helga Pietersen, an employee of
	the South African Navy Hydrographic Office (SANHO), from 6th – 10th July. Gailen
	spent her the first part of the week with Mike, IC-ENC Data Manager/IC-ENC
	Course Instructor, in order to familiarise her with IC-ENC's core services. Gailen
	then spent time with each member of the Validation team, who took her through the
	entire Validation process.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	We were pleased to welcome Scott Drayton, our new IC-ENC Assistant Technical
	Manager, to the team on 20th July. Scott will be working in IC-ENC for a contracted
	period of 12 months to deliver improvements to IC-ENC services and information
	technology as defined in IC-ENC's Target Operating Model.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	We were also delighted to welcome Dr. Mathias Jonas, IC-ENC Chairman and
	Hydrographer of the German Hydrographic Office (BSH), to IC-ENC HQ on Tuesday
	28th July. Mathias spent the day discussing some of the agenda topics for the fast
	approaching Steering Committee16 meeting. In addition, Mathias was briefed on
	some of the ongoing projects within IC-ENC by individual members of the team.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Steering Committee 16 is approaching swiftly, and IC-ENC is currently working on
	the discussion papers for the meeting. All discussion papers will be circulated one
	month before the meeting takes place to allow delegates to familiarise themselves
	with the topics listed for discussion in the agenda. If you have not yet replied to your
	invitation, but you would like to attend, please send your travel form to me as soon
	as possible on laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Shortly after Steering Committee 16, our third and final IC-ENC International
	Validation training course of 2015 will be taking place in Panama from 14th – 25th
	September. Mike, IC-ENC Course Instructor/IC-ENC Data Manager, is currently
	working hard to ensure all of the final arrangements for the course are under way for
	the 15 delegates who will be attending the training course in September.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Lastly, we are sad to inform you that Sidney Osborne has recently announced
	his retirement from his post at the South African Hydrographic Office (SANHO). We
	have been in correspondence with Sidney since IC-ENC was set up in 2002, with
	South Africa being one of IC-ENC's first members. Below are a few words from
	Sidney himself:
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	"IC-ENC and the South African Hydrographic Office have had a long and very fruitful
	relationship over the years, so I certainly will reflect warmly on the great times I've
	had with many of the IC-ENC members, past and present here in South Africa and
	abroad. Without singling out any members at IC-ENC, I would like to convey my
	best wishes to all who may remember me, and I hope they continue to enjoy their
	careers in the unique world of ENCs and IC-ENC. I am also that sure those who
	follow in my footsteps in the SANHO will also discover and experience first hand the
	good cordial manner in which IC-ENC provides the valuable service to its
	members".

	Some of you may have already seen and read the news announcement on the
	website regarding the development of a new regional office in Brazil, to be known as
	IC-ENC Latin America. This new office will be developed in partnership with the
	Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN), and will be located in the Niteroi
	offices of DHN, near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The initiative was approved by the IC-
	ENC Steering Committee following the near-unanimous results of a vote, and
	now IC-ENC and DHN will begin to develop the new regional office in line with the
	approved business case.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Mike has now settled back into the team after hosting the IC-ENC International
	Validation training course, which was held in Wollongong, Australia, from 25th May
	until 5th July. The course was a great success, with even more working
	relationships built and knowledge shared between nations. It was also a good
	opportunity to work closely with the IC-ENC Australia team, and in addition ex-IC-
	ENC Chairman, Rod Nairn, was there to present the certificates to the delegates at
	the end of the course.

	James visited the offices of NOAA to discuss ENC production and validation
	concepts, before moving on to Mexico City to represent IC-ENC at the IHO’s IRCC7
	meeting. WEND matters were discussed and James also formally announced IC-
	ENC's decision to launch the new regional office in Latin America. James then
	travelled to Panama City to visit the two ENC producing organizations. James
	visited the Panama Maritime Authority, who recently joined IC-ENC,
	to provide guidance on the next stages of ENC production. He then met with the IC-
	ENC contacts within the Panama Canal Authority, where he was shown the training
	facilities which have been made available for IC-ENC to deliver its International
	Validation training course in September. Following the return from this trip, James
	will be working towards the upcoming MBSHC meeting, which is to be held in
	Georgia between 30th June and 2nd July. He will then be concentrating on the
	preparation of discussion papers for Steering Committee 16 in September.

	Last week's exchange set, on 26th June, was the largest exchange set of data that
	IC-ENC has ever validated and released. The exchange set contains a total of 269
	files, including 226 updates, 41 new editions, and 2 new cells. This brings the total
	number of ENCs released by IC-ENC to 5,619. This is a stark contrast to last year,
	when the average number of ENC files issued per week was 131. A big well done to
	the team for their efforts!
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	As part of Kevin's last day in IC-ENC, we had a team building day out at Go
	Segway. For those of you who are not familiar with a segway, it is a two-wheeled,
	self-balancing, electric powered vehicle, and is the latest
	trend in 'green' transportation. During our segway safari tour, we took on obstacles,
	hills and sharp turns, and it quickly became apparent who was (and who was not!) a
	natural segway master. All in all, it was a great experience, and it was a good
	opportunity for the team to relax, enjoy themselves, and have a good laugh together.

			This week, IC-ENC has validated and released the largest amount of ENC data
			since records began!
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The exchange set contains a total of 269 files, including 226 updates, 41 new
			editions, and 2 new cells. This brings the total number of ENCs released by IC-ENC
			to 5,619. This is a stark contrast to last year, when the average number of ENC files
			issued per week was 131.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			2015 has already been a busy six months in general for the IC-ENC Validation
			Team, supporting IC-ENC members in their ENC production and ENC maintenance
			responsibilities, in addition to various other office projects and tasks.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			A big well done to the team for their efforts!

			IC-ENC is pleased to announce the development of a new regional office in Brazil to
			be known as IC-ENC Latin America.  This new regional office will be developed in
			partnership with the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN) and will be
			located in the Niterói offices of DHN, near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The governing board of IC-ENC, the IC-ENC Steering Committee, approved this
			new initiative via a vote.  The result was a near-unanimous approval, therefore, IC-
			ENC and DHN will now begin to develop the new regional office in line with the
			approved business case.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The first stage is for IC-ENC to train DHN staff in the IC-ENC ENC quality
			assurance practices, who will then be considered 'on loan' to IC-ENC.  The stringent
			IC-ENC requirements in terms of staff performance and competence will be reached
			during 2015, with the IC-ENC Latin America office achieving full operating capability
			in early 2016.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The primary reason for establishing IC-ENC Latin America is to provide localised
			ENC Production and Validation support to a significant portion of IC-ENC members
			in this region.  Additional benefits are related to time zone in terms of a longer IC-
			ENC international working day and therefore improved response times to its
			customers, delivering support in the dominant regional language of Spanish, and
			enhancing the 'international' aspect of IC-ENC with the development of a global
			network.  The new regional office will also allow IC-ENC to demonstrate the benefits
			of its new technology in terms of communication and workflow between offices,
			delivering enhanced services to its Hydrographic Office members and its Value
			Added Reseller ENC distribution partners.

			<br>

			We are now into the second week of the IC-ENC International Validation Training
			Course, which is currently being held in Australia. The delegates have spent the first
			week learning about IC-ENC's mission, aims and process, in addition to data supply
			and IC-ENC's internal software. The delegates then spent the weekend exploring
			Sydney and Wollongong, and getting to know each other better over a nice meal
			and a drink or two. The second week of the course will focus on data consistency,
			validation reports and the distribution of data. 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The third training course to be held this year will take place in Panama. Initial
			invitations to attend the Panama course will be sent out this week. Please contact
			Mike Hawes at mike.hawes@ic-enc.org for further information, or if you have any
			questions.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The concept of providing ECDIS software to IC-ENC members was discussed and
			agreed at SC15, and so we have spent some time evaluating two options,
			TRANSAS and 7Cs, for functionality and cost benefit. As a result, the 7Cs eGlobe2
			ECDIS has been selected for its ease of installation on office hardware, its
			performance for data quality assessment tasks, and its value for money.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Accordingly, IC-ENC has purchased 40 licenses for this software, for use in our
			offices and to supply to members. Familiarisation training will be delivered to
			delegates attending the Australia and Panama training courses, and they will return
			to their home organisations with software to install locally. The delegates who
			attended the UK training course in February will also be provided with the software,
			and guidance will be provided directly from IC-ENC as required. To provide further
			guidance and support for all members, IC-ENC has developed a comprehensive
			installation and user guide, alongside 7Cs, which focuses on data quality and data
			assessment.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Again, the dataflow within IC-ENC remains high, and as of week 22 we have now
			released a total of 5,577 ENCs. This number will continue to increase over the next
			couple of weeks as we validate and release 50 new cells produced by the
			Netherlands Hydrographic Office (NLHO).
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We are pleased to announce that IC-ENC has appointed a new member of staff at
			the UK office, Ms Liz Hahessy. Liz has been appointed to prepare IC-ENC for future
			services and the changes that will be required to support our members as the S-100
			suite of data standards develop, most notably the ENC Standard S-101. Liz will also
			contribute to other areas, in addition to providing cover to our business critical post
			of Technical Manager.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Liz's background is in Geography and Geology, having achieved a BSc in Geology
			from Cardiff University, as well as an MSc in Quaternary Science from the University
			of London. Following her academic studies, Liz went on to work for the Environment
			Agency as a Regulatory Water Quality Officer. Subsequently, she joined the UKHO
			in 2007 as a Mapping and Charting Officer in the VAR Team prior to the launch of
			AVCS (Admiralty Vector Chart Service). In 2009, Liz undertook the UKHO
			compilation training course, achieving IHO Cat B accreditation and then settling as a
			compiler in the Home Waters chart branch. In 2011, Liz became a DDMT (Digital
			Data Management Team) Manager, where she was responsible for acquiring and
			quality assessing ENC data from RENCs and FGHOs for inclusion in the weekly
			AVCS and AIO (Admiralty Information Overlay) service. This required a good
			working knowledge of IHO Standards, ECDIS systems and validation software tools
			such as Jeppesen's dKart Inspector and 7Cs ENC Analyzer. In this post, Liz was
			also involved in two major projects developing the CASTLE independent validation
			tool and Torus, which is due to replace the Moebius database. Liz was promoted to
			Digital Team Leader of the DDMT, AIO and RENC Liaison teams in January 2014,
			where she led, managed and supported the teams through UKHO restructure and
			process changes.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We are very much looking forward to working with Liz and welcoming her to the
			team!
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			As part of the staff structure review, and in order to realistically balance IC-ENC
			headcount and budget for staff costs, Mr Kevin Black, IC-ENC Assistant Technical
			Manager, will be transferring to the UKHO. The Assistant Technical Manager role is
			responsible for delivering IC-ENC's new technology and will cease upon completion,
			so this role will be filled by a short term secondment from the UKHO and specialist
			contractor skills.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Kevin has been with IC-ENC for over two years, and will be known to most of your
			teams as the first line of support for any technology queries such as data transfer
			account set up. He has also briefed the Steering Committee on IC-ENC technology,
			and has put in place the foundations on which our new technology will be built.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Kevin has always been a pleasure to work with, and we wish him the best of luck
			with the next stage of his career.

			I hope you all had a lovely Easter break, and you've returned feeling refreshed! 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Firstly, a quick update on SC16. I will be starting to book flights for SC16 imminently,
			so if you have not yet returned your travel forms to me, please make every effort to
			do so as soon as possible. Please remember that IC-ENC has opted to pay for the
			travel and accommodation costs of one delegate per nation, so if you would like to
			send more than one delegate, the additional travel and accommodation costs must
			be met your organisation.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			IC-ENC has had visits from several nations this month, including both some familiar
			faces from the Netherlands Hydrographic Office, and some new faces from
			the Myanmar Naval Hydrographic Centre and several Omani students who are
			currently on a two week training course at the UK Hydrographic Office. We hope all
			of our visitors enjoyed meeting and spending some time with the team, we certainly
			did!
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The dataflow within IC-ENC remains at a high, and as a result, our total number of
			ENCs released now stands at 5,558 ENCs as of week 18.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			For those producing nations using 7Cs ENC Analyzer, we'd like to bring to your
			attention the change in criteria which has resulted in the error message
			'VS57_ATT_49' being reported in our validation work much more frequently. – you
			may have noticed in your validation reports! This has occurred since we have
			upgraded ENC Analyzer to version 3.3.1.218568. The error message reports that
			the mandatory attributes CATREA (category of restriction) and RESTRN (restriction)
			are missing for RESARE (restricted area).
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Previously, the error would only be reported if both mandatory attributes were
			missing, but now the error will be reported even if one of the mandatory attributes
			has been populated. If this is the case, and one mandatory attribute has been
			populated, the error can be classified as 'erroneous', and no further action would be
			required. However, if both mandatory attributes are missing or left empty and there
			is no additional information about the nature of the restricted area in INFORM or
			TXTDSC, then the error will be classified as 'HO to correct'. To resolve the error, at
			least one of the mandatory attributes must be populated, or alternatively, if it is
			easier to describe the nature of the restricted area, then INFORM or TXTDSC can
			be populated.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We are now looking forward to the next IC-ENC International Validation training
			course, which is to be held in Wollongong, Australia from 25th May until 5th June, for
			a period of two weeks. There are now 12 confirmed delegates on the course,
			attending from Australia, Bahrain, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan and the
			Philippines. Mike Hawes, Course Instructor, is very much looking forward to meeting
			all of the delegates in Wollongong on 25th May.

		<i>'Nobody can stop natural disaster, we are the cause and we are the remedy'</i> – 
		Santosh Kalwar
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		I'm sure that all of you are aware of the recent cyclone which hit Vanuatu on
		13th March, causing much devastation to the chain of small South Pacific islands.
		Cyclone Pam, as it was named, has now been regarded as one of the most severe
		tropical cyclone disasters in the history of Vanuatu, and has resulted in the tragic
		loss of 16 lives. The majority of the damage lies with the capital of Port Vila,
		although other parts of the 65 inhabited islands have also been affected by the
		natural disaster. The United Nations have now confirmed that humanitarian aid has
		been delivered to all of the affected islands of the country, providing food packages
		and water for more than 166,000 people.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		In order to further support the humanitarian aid being provided by the United
		Nations, as well as many other charity relief projects such as Oxfam, UNICEF, and
		the Australian Red Cross, IC-ENC will be releasing two up-to-date ENCs of Port
		Vila, produced by UKHO. These two ENCs are now available unencrypted and free
		of charge via the IC-ENC website, and will also be included in this week's exchange
		set.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		On a separate note, James attended the North Indian Ocean Hydrographic
		Commission (NIOHC) meeting in Oman, which was held from 16th – 18th March. At
		the meeting, James delivered a joint presentation with Cdr. Ahmed Naguib from the
		Egyptian Navy Hydrographic Department (ENHD). The presentation provided an
		insight into ENHD's experiences of IC-ENC as a new member, and discussed IC-
		ENC's provision of services and production support to ENHD during the joining
		period.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The flow of data into IC-ENC remains high, with week 11 containing 239
		individual ENC files, which makes it our largest exchange set since 2011. As a
		result, the total number of issued ENCs now stands at 5,535 as of week 13. Whilst
		on the topic of data, here is a quick reminder that this week's exchange set (week
		14) will be released a day early, on Thursday 2nd April 2015.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		On a final note, I wish everyone a very Happy Easter!
