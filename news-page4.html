				<br>

				We are pleased to confirm the IC-ENC Technical Conference (TC01) will be taking
				place from Wednesday 27th April to Friday 29th April 2016. The conference will be
				held at the Holiday Inn, Taunton, UK. 
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The Technical Conference will be an excellent opportunity for technical staff from all
				IC-ENC members' offices to meet and discuss any ENC production or data capture
				issues that they face. It will also be a great way to build working relationships and
				learn from colleagues with similar experiences in cartography and software usage.
				IC-ENC will also use this conference to take the opportunity to ensure all our
				members are aware of recent developments and the assistance that IC-ENC can
				provide.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Invitations have been sent via email, and we are looking forward to receiving your
				replies by Monday 15th February. If you did not receive an email invitation, please

				<br>

				Welcome back! I hope you all had a lovely break, and you've come back feeling
				refreshed and ready for a 2016 full of fresh possibilities.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We are pleased to announce that 10 ENCs from the Panama Maritime Authority
				were released on 22nd December 2015 (week 52 exchange set). This is an exciting
				time for the Panama Maritime Authority, and we look forward to working with them
				further in due course.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We look forward to welcoming two delegates from NOAA, who will be the new IC-
				ENC North America Validators, at the end of January. We also look forward to
				welcoming back the two delegates from the Diretoria de Hidrografia e Navegação
				(DHN) in Brazil, who previously spent three weeks with us at IC-ENC HQ in
				November 2015. These four delegates will be spending three months at IC-ENC HQ
				on secondment in order to provide IC-ENC Validation and Regional Office training
				for when they start their roles at the new IC-ENC Latin America and IC-ENC North
				America regional offices.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				In addition, we will be welcoming a delegation from Venezuela to IC-ENC HQ
				from 7th - 16th March 2016. We look forward to spending time with the delegation to
				discuss ENC Production and ENC Validation matters.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We are currently in the process of organising the IC-ENC Technical Conference,
				which will be held in Taunton, UK during the week commencing 25th April 2016. The
				conference will run over the course of three days, with one main topic listed for
				discussion each day. These topics will include S-57, S-100 and S-101 and the IC-
				ENC Validation Service and Technology. The proposed format is:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Day 1: S-57:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				• Report from IHO ENC Working Group
				<br>
				• Sharing of best practice encoding techniques (recent changes)
				<br>
				• Changes and publication of S-58 version xx: what does this mean to the
				  encoder?
				<br>
				• Optional session: eGlobe ECDIS training (including installation process).
				  Applicable to those members who have not already received the software form
				  IC-ENC. This will complete the ECDIS roll out to all members
				 
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Day 2: S-100 & S-101:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				• Report from IHO S101 Working Group, including timeline
				<br>
				• Review of each member national position with respect to the new ENC
				standard. (A questionnaire will have been completed by each member prior to
				the Conference)
				<br>
				• Establish parameters for IC-ENC S-101 support to members
				<br>
				• Set plan for IC-ENC to develop the concept further to present to SC17
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Day 3: IC-ENC Validation Service and Technology - Changes and Improvements our
				members need to know:
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				• IC-ENC Global Operating model (role of HQ and regional offices)
				<br>
				• IC-ENC Errors Database improvements
				<br>
				• IC-ENC website and support information (log in area)
				<br>
				• Data Transfer methodology
				<br>
				• Plans for 2016 Bronze IC-ENC ENC Validation courses (SC decision SC16/9)
				<br>
				• Plans 2017 and 2018: Discuss future of the TEWG/Technical Conference 
				format/frequency/structure – what will give most benefit to members.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				As we are expecting a high level of attendance, IC-ENC will cover the travel and
				accommodation costs for one delegate from each member HO. If an HO wishes to
				send more than one delegate, we will ask the HO to cover the travel and
				accommodation costs for the additional delegates. The venue, and further details
				will be provided as soon as possible.

			With huge thanks to the IC-ENC Technical Team and the Novo systems support
			team, we are happy to announce that the migration to the cloud environment has
			been a success, and we have now been working on our new operating systems for
			a month. The next stage is to enable IC-ENC Australia to gain access to the IC-ENC
			cloud environment, allowing the two offices to operate more efficiently with one
			another. Both IC-ENC Latin America and IC-ENC North America will follow in 2016.

			<br>
			<br>
			
			This month, we had inbound visits from Egypt and Malta. It was a great
			opportunity to spend some time with both delegations discussing IC-ENC's ENC
			production and validation services. 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Last week, we attended a talk held by Rachel Medley from the National Oceanic
			and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This was a great opportunity to learn more
			about the different divisions within NOAA, and a result we are really excited for the
			development and launch of IC-ENC North America, and our working partnership
			with NOAA to go forward in 2016.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We currently have two delegates from the Diretoria de Hidrografia e Navegação
			(DHN) in Brazil at IC-ENC HQ for a three week secondment. The aim of this
			secondment is to provide IC-ENC Validation training for the two delegates, who will
			be working in the IC-ENC Latin America office once it is launched in early 2016. The
			two delegates will be spending their time at IC-ENC HQ learning about all of IC-
			ENC's operating processes, particularly the ENC Validation processes which they
			will be performing back in the IC-ENC Latin America office.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We continue to experience a high validation workload, with average weekly
			exchange sets of 160 ENCs.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			IC-ENC will remain open throughout the Christmas period, and we will respond to
			email queries as quickly as possible during this time. The calendar below shows
			which days the IC-ENC UK office will be open:

				<br>

				IC-ENC is excited to announce the release of the first Slovenian ENC, produced by
				the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia.  This ENC will be released to the IC-ENC VARs
				for distribution on 6th November 2015.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Although the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia started the production of ENCs a few
				years ago, and completed a substantial amount of work, they were unable to
				validate it properly and issue ENCs formally without being a member of a RENC.
				Since joining IC-ENC in July 2014 as IC-ENC's 31st member nation, the Geodetic
				Institute of Slovenia has benefited from IC-ENC's full support to develop its in-house
				ENC production capacity through IC-ENC's Independent ENC Validation, Production
				Support and Capacity Building (training) services.  IC-ENC prides itself on the
				provision of assistance to its members, regardless of when they joined or their ENC
				production capability. IC-ENC's ENC Production services include direct contact with the
				IC-ENC Validation Team via email, telephone and Skype.  The IC-ENC
				Validation Team strive to provide timely responses to any issues, queries or general
				feedback from members.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Above all, the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia has greatly benefitted from attending
				IC-ENC's International ENC Validation Training Course.  Matija Klanjšček,
				Cartographer, attended the training course in February 2015, along with nine other
				delegates from different Hydrographic Offices.  Matija thoroughly enjoyed the
				training opportunity, highlighting that he has noticed significant improvements to his
				understanding of ENC production and ENC validation processes. He also
				emphasized how great it was to meet the IC-ENC staff and representatives of other
				Hydrographic Offices to exchange information and experiences.  As a result, he was
				more than happy to present his feedback to the IC-ENC Steering Committee during
				this year's meeting held back in September.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC has delivered three International ENC Validation training courses during
				2015, held in Taunton (UK), Wollongong (Australia) and Panama (Central America).
				The training course provides its members with the knowledge and skills required to
				perform data validation at their home ENC production offices.  The training course
				runs for a period of two weeks, and runs through the entire ENC Validation process
				from start to finish, as well as providing an overview of IC-ENC's additional three
				core services:  ENC production support, ENC distribution and ENC revenue
				management. One specific element of the course is designed to enable each user to
				gain the maximum benefit from the ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS, which IC-ENC
				has selected as a tool to provide its 38 member nations with to supplement ENC
				production and validation processes.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC will be holding three further training courses in 2016.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Following the release of the first ENC, the Port of Koper (Band 5), Slovenia plan to
				continue with ENC production covering the wider area of Bay of Koper (Band 4),
				and eventually covering the whole territorial waters of the Republic of Slovenia with
				another ENC of a smaller scale.

			    A shorter update this month, but I will start with some good news!
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We are excited to announce the release of the first Slovenian ENC; a great
				achievement for the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia. This ENC will be released on 6th
				November 2015.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				IC-ENC prides itself on the provision of assistance to its members, regardless of
				when they joined or the extent of their ENC production capability. It is fantastic to
				see how well the ENC production staff at the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia have
				benefited from IC-ENC's Independent ENC Validation and ENC Production Support
				services, as well as IC-ENC's International ENC Validation Training Course. As part
				of their production plan, the Geodetic Institute of Slovenia intend to release a further
				4 ENCs during 2016.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				James has just returned from the PRIMAR Advisory Committee (PAC) meeting in
				Paris, where he was briefed on PRIMAR's developments over the past year. As
				agreed at the last Steering Committee (SC16), the Open Sessions will now cease.
				Instead, a series of more regular meetings will take place between the Chairs and
				Management of IC-ENC and PRIMAR, with written reports submitted following each
				PAC and SC meeting.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				We also had a visit from the Turkish Hydrographic Office last week to discuss the
				next Steering Committee meeting, which Turkey has kindly offered to host, as well
				as to spend some time with the team at IC-ENC HQ.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Richard Northover, IC-ENC Commercial Manager, has finished preparing the Q3
				sales reports and new ENC wholesale pricing list, both of which will be distributed to
				members imminently.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The IC-ENC Technical Team have been very busy working on the new technology
				developments, and carrying out various forms of testing to ensure that the systems
				are ready to be implemented. This is an exciting time for IC-ENC as we migrate to a
				Cloud-based working environment, whilst facilitating consistency between all IC-
				ENC regional offices, and the growth of IC-ENC as a whole.

		IC-ENC has selected the new ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS as a tool to provide
		their 37 member nations with to supplement ENC production and validation
		processes.  This will give each member Hydrographic Office the opportunity to load
		their ENCs into an ECDIS in order that the maritime user's perspective can be
		considered and to check its interoperability with adjacent data.  
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The SevenCs display engine inside the ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS is used by
		30% of all ECDIS and ECS users within the SOLAS market, allowing IC-ENC and its
		members to make a representative data assessment on a user friendly ECDIS,
		whilst following the latest performance standards.  The ChartWorld eGlobe G2
		ECDIS software will be supplied to those member nations following attendance on
		IC-ENC's International ENC Validation training course.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC has delivered three International ENC Validation training courses this year,
		each held in a different part of the world. The first training course was held in
		Taunton, UK, in February 2015.  The second was held in Wollongong, Australia, in
		May, and the third course has just been delivered in Panama, Central America
		during September.  The course provides its members with the knowledge and skills
		required to perform data validation at their home ENC production offices.  The
		training course runs for a period of two weeks, and runs through the entire ENC
		Validation process from start to finish, as well as providing an overview of IC-ENC's
		additional three core services:  ENC production support, ENC distribution and ENC
		revenue management.  One specific element of the course is designed to enable
		each user to gain the maximum benefit from the ChartWorld eGlobe G2 ECDIS.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The Slovenian Hydrographic Office commented: "The most useful parts of the
		course were being able to get to know the whole process of validation from start to
		finish, and meeting IC-ENC staff members and representatives of other
		Hydrographic Office to exchange information and experiences amongst ourselves".
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC will be holding three further training courses in 2016, for which a further
		ECDIS delivery schedule plan will be implemented.

	It feels like it's been a long time since my last blog, so I have plenty of IC-ENC
	activities to update you all on!
  
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Mike Hawes, IC-ENC Course Trainer/Data Manager has just delivered the third and
	final IC-ENC ENC Validation Training Course of 2015 (bronze level). The course
	was held in Panama for a period of two weeks, from 14th – 25th September. The
	course was delivered to 18 delegates from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba,
	Ecuador, Panama Canal Authority, Panama Maritime Authority, Peru, Suriname,
	Uruguay, United States, and Venezuela.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	On behalf of the whole IC-ENC team, I'd like to say a big thank you to the Panama
	Canal Authority, in particular Jaime Rodriguez, for offering IC-ENC their training
	facilities to host the training course.

	Richard Northover, IC-ENC Commercial Manager, attended the World ECDIS Day
	event, which was held in Hamburg on 16th September. Richard briefed three groups
	of shipping companies, OEM reps and members of the shipping community. He also
	gave a joint RENC presentation with Hans Lauritzen, PRIMAR Director, which was
	well received.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	The annual IC-ENC Steering Committee meeting took place on 7th and 8th
	September in Munich, Germany. We had a record number of 51 attendees,
	representing 31 out of our 36 member Hydrographic offices. The meeting was very
	successful, with some good discussions and decisions made, and the minutes from
	the meeting have now been circulated for review. If you have any comments or
	questions regarding the minutes, please email me on laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org (cc:
	therenc@ic-enc.org) by Friday 2nd October.

	We are excited to announce our latest IC-ENC member developments: Israel, Oman
	and NOAA (US). The Survey of Israel (SOI) joined as our 36th member in August.
	We will be working with SOI to develop its in-house production capabilities in order
	to assist in the production and maintenance of their ENC data. The Oman National
	Hydrographic Office (ONHO) joined as our 37th member during the Steering
	Committee meeting. ONHO currently has seven ENCs, and IC-ENC will provide
	further support in order to assist the development of its in-house ENC production
	capabilities. In addition, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
	(NOAA) have entered into the initial phase of becoming our 38th member. This
	decision was reached following the Steering Committee's endorsement of the
	proposal to establish a fourth IC-ENC regional office in Washington, DC, USA, as
	well as the approval of NOAA's intended membership. The membership
	arrangements and inclusion of the new office into IC-ENC's global operating
	framework are now subject to further analysis and development by both the NOAA
	and IC-ENC teams. Further announcements will be made in due course.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Lastly, whilst we're on the subject of IC-ENC regional offices, I thought I'd take this
	opportunity to update you all on the progress being made at the IC-ENC Latin
	America regional office in Niteroi, Brazil. The office accommodation has now been
	established, and the appointed staff members are now working in the office and
	taking part in regular online meetings with IC-ENC HQ. The two appointed Data
	Validators have just completed the bronze level training course in Panama, and
	formal gold level training is planned to be held in Taunton at a later date.

		IC-ENC is proud to announce that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
		Administration (NOAA) have entered into the initial phase of becoming the 38th
		national hydrographic office to join its rapidly increasing family of members.   
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The 2015 IC-ENC annual Steering Committee meeting in Munich, Germany
		approved NOAA's intended membership of IC-ENC and endorsed a proposal for
		NOAA and IC-ENC to establish a fourth regional office of IC-ENC in Washington, 
		DC, USA. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The membership arrangements, and the inclusion of the new office into IC-ENC's
		global operating framework, are now subject to detailed analysis and development
		by the NOAA and IC-ENC teams.  Further announcements will follow as the IC-ENC
		North America office develops full operating capability during 2016. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		NOAA currently produces and maintains over 1000 ENCs.  IC-ENC's Production
		Support including Capacity Building (Training) and Independent Validation services
		will be delivered to NOAA via the IC-ENC North America office.  The NOAA ENCs
		will form part of the global IC-ENC folio, and be included in IC-ENC's ENC
		Distribution service, achieved through the main IC-ENC office in the UK, 

		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC is looking forward to working in partnership with NOAA and assisting in
		sustaining this important ENC coverage.

		IC-ENC welcomes Oman National Hydrographic Office (ONHO), which has become
		the 37th national Hydrographic Office to join its rapidly increasing family of
		members.  This was achieved by the signing of documentation during IC-ENCs
		annual Steering Committee meeting, in 2015 taking place in Munich, Germany.  
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		ONHO currently has 7 ENCs, and IC-ENC intends to provide further support in order
		to assist and develop its in-house ENC production capacity. This will be achieved
		through IC-ENC's Production Support, Independent Validation and Capacity Building
		(Training) services.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC is looking forward to working in partnership with ONHO and assisting in the
		development of this important ENC coverage.
