			This week, IC-ENC has validated and released the largest amount of ENC data
			since records began!
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The exchange set contains a total of 269 files, including 226 updates, 41 new
			editions, and 2 new cells. This brings the total number of ENCs released by IC-ENC
			to 5,619. This is a stark contrast to last year, when the average number of ENC files
			issued per week was 131.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			2015 has already been a busy six months in general for the IC-ENC Validation
			Team, supporting IC-ENC members in their ENC production and ENC maintenance
			responsibilities, in addition to various other office projects and tasks.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			A big well done to the team for their efforts!

			IC-ENC is pleased to announce the development of a new regional office in Brazil to
			be known as IC-ENC Latin America.  This new regional office will be developed in
			partnership with the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN) and will be
			located in the Niter√≥i offices of DHN, near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The governing board of IC-ENC, the IC-ENC Steering Committee, approved this
			new initiative via a vote.  The result was a near-unanimous approval, therefore, IC-
			ENC and DHN will now begin to develop the new regional office in line with the
			approved business case.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The first stage is for IC-ENC to train DHN staff in the IC-ENC ENC quality
			assurance practices, who will then be considered 'on loan' to IC-ENC.  The stringent
			IC-ENC requirements in terms of staff performance and competence will be reached
			during 2015, with the IC-ENC Latin America office achieving full operating capability
			in early 2016.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The primary reason for establishing IC-ENC Latin America is to provide localised
			ENC Production and Validation support to a significant portion of IC-ENC members
			in this region.  Additional benefits are related to time zone in terms of a longer IC-
			ENC international working day and therefore improved response times to its
			customers, delivering support in the dominant regional language of Spanish, and
			enhancing the 'international' aspect of IC-ENC with the development of a global
			network.  The new regional office will also allow IC-ENC to demonstrate the benefits
			of its new technology in terms of communication and workflow between offices,
			delivering enhanced services to its Hydrographic Office members and its Value
			Added Reseller ENC distribution partners.

			<br>

			We are now into the second week of the IC-ENC International Validation Training
			Course, which is currently being held in Australia. The delegates have spent the first
			week learning about IC-ENC's mission, aims and process, in addition to data supply
			and IC-ENC's internal software. The delegates then spent the weekend exploring
			Sydney and Wollongong, and getting to know each other better over a nice meal
			and a drink or two. The second week of the course will focus on data consistency,
			validation reports and the distribution of data. 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The third training course to be held this year will take place in Panama. Initial
			invitations to attend the Panama course will be sent out this week. Please contact
			Mike Hawes at mike.hawes@ic-enc.org for further information, or if you have any
			questions.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The concept of providing ECDIS software to IC-ENC members was discussed and
			agreed at SC15, and so we have spent some time evaluating two options,
			TRANSAS and 7Cs, for functionality and cost benefit. As a result, the 7Cs eGlobe2
			ECDIS has been selected for its ease of installation on office hardware, its
			performance for data quality assessment tasks, and its value for money.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Accordingly, IC-ENC has purchased 40 licenses for this software, for use in our
			offices and to supply to members. Familiarisation training will be delivered to
			delegates attending the Australia and Panama training courses, and they will return
			to their home organisations with software to install locally. The delegates who
			attended the UK training course in February will also be provided with the software,
			and guidance will be provided directly from IC-ENC as required. To provide further
			guidance and support for all members, IC-ENC has developed a comprehensive
			installation and user guide, alongside 7Cs, which focuses on data quality and data
			assessment.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Again, the dataflow within IC-ENC remains high, and as of week 22 we have now
			released a total of 5,577 ENCs. This number will continue to increase over the next
			couple of weeks as we validate and release 50 new cells produced by the
			Netherlands Hydrographic Office (NLHO).
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We are pleased to announce that IC-ENC has appointed a new member of staff at
			the UK office, Ms Liz Hahessy. Liz has been appointed to prepare IC-ENC for future
			services and the changes that will be required to support our members as the S-100
			suite of data standards develop, most notably the ENC Standard S-101. Liz will also
			contribute to other areas, in addition to providing cover to our business critical post
			of Technical Manager.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Liz's background is in Geography and Geology, having achieved a BSc in Geology
			from Cardiff University, as well as an MSc in Quaternary Science from the University
			of London. Following her academic studies, Liz went on to work for the Environment
			Agency as a Regulatory Water Quality Officer. Subsequently, she joined the UKHO
			in 2007 as a Mapping and Charting Officer in the VAR Team prior to the launch of
			AVCS (Admiralty Vector Chart Service). In 2009, Liz undertook the UKHO
			compilation training course, achieving IHO Cat B accreditation and then settling as a
			compiler in the Home Waters chart branch. In 2011, Liz became a DDMT (Digital
			Data Management Team) Manager, where she was responsible for acquiring and
			quality assessing ENC data from RENCs and FGHOs for inclusion in the weekly
			AVCS and AIO (Admiralty Information Overlay) service. This required a good
			working knowledge of IHO Standards, ECDIS systems and validation software tools
			such as Jeppesen's dKart Inspector and 7Cs ENC Analyzer. In this post, Liz was
			also involved in two major projects developing the CASTLE independent validation
			tool and Torus, which is due to replace the Moebius database. Liz was promoted to
			Digital Team Leader of the DDMT, AIO and RENC Liaison teams in January 2014,
			where she led, managed and supported the teams through UKHO restructure and
			process changes.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We are very much looking forward to working with Liz and welcoming her to the
			team!
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			As part of the staff structure review, and in order to realistically balance IC-ENC
			headcount and budget for staff costs, Mr Kevin Black, IC-ENC Assistant Technical
			Manager, will be transferring to the UKHO. The Assistant Technical Manager role is
			responsible for delivering IC-ENC's new technology and will cease upon completion,
			so this role will be filled by a short term secondment from the UKHO and specialist
			contractor skills.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Kevin has been with IC-ENC for over two years, and will be known to most of your
			teams as the first line of support for any technology queries such as data transfer
			account set up. He has also briefed the Steering Committee on IC-ENC technology,
			and has put in place the foundations on which our new technology will be built.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Kevin has always been a pleasure to work with, and we wish him the best of luck
			with the next stage of his career.

			I hope you all had a lovely Easter break, and you've returned feeling refreshed! 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Firstly, a quick update on SC16. I will be starting to book flights for SC16 imminently,
			so if you have not yet returned your travel forms to me, please make every effort to
			do so as soon as possible. Please remember that IC-ENC has opted to pay for the
			travel and accommodation costs of one delegate per nation, so if you would like to
			send more than one delegate, the additional travel and accommodation costs must
			be met your organisation.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			IC-ENC has had visits from several nations this month, including both some familiar
			faces from the Netherlands Hydrographic Office, and some new faces from
			the Myanmar Naval Hydrographic Centre and several Omani students who are
			currently on a two week training course at the UK Hydrographic Office. We hope all
			of our visitors enjoyed meeting and spending some time with the team, we certainly
			did!
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The dataflow within IC-ENC remains at a high, and as a result, our total number of
			ENCs released now stands at 5,558 ENCs as of week 18.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			For those producing nations using 7Cs ENC Analyzer, we'd like to bring to your
			attention the change in criteria which has resulted in the error message
			'VS57_ATT_49' being reported in our validation work much more frequently. ‚Äì you
			may have noticed in your validation reports! This has occurred since we have
			upgraded ENC Analyzer to version 3.3.1.218568. The error message reports that
			the mandatory attributes CATREA (category of restriction) and RESTRN (restriction)
			are missing for RESARE (restricted area).
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Previously, the error would only be reported if both mandatory attributes were
			missing, but now the error will be reported even if one of the mandatory attributes
			has been populated. If this is the case, and one mandatory attribute has been
			populated, the error can be classified as 'erroneous', and no further action would be
			required. However, if both mandatory attributes are missing or left empty and there
			is no additional information about the nature of the restricted area in INFORM or
			TXTDSC, then the error will be classified as 'HO to correct'. To resolve the error, at
			least one of the mandatory attributes must be populated, or alternatively, if it is
			easier to describe the nature of the restricted area, then INFORM or TXTDSC can
			be populated.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			We are now looking forward to the next IC-ENC International Validation training
			course, which is to be held in Wollongong, Australia from 25th May until 5th June, for
			a period of two weeks. There are now 12 confirmed delegates on the course,
			attending from Australia, Bahrain, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan and the
			Philippines. Mike Hawes, Course Instructor, is very much looking forward to meeting
			all of the delegates in Wollongong on 25th May.

		<i>'Nobody can stop natural disaster, we are the cause and we are the remedy'</i> ‚Äì 
		Santosh Kalwar
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		I'm sure that all of you are aware of the recent cyclone which hit Vanuatu on
		13th March, causing much devastation to the chain of small South Pacific islands.
		Cyclone Pam, as it was named, has now been regarded as one of the most severe
		tropical cyclone disasters in the history of Vanuatu, and has resulted in the tragic
		loss of 16 lives. The majority of the damage lies with the capital of Port Vila,
		although other parts of the 65 inhabited islands have also been affected by the
		natural disaster. The United Nations have now confirmed that humanitarian aid has
		been delivered to all of the affected islands of the country, providing food packages
		and water for more than 166,000 people.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		In order to further support the humanitarian aid being provided by the United
		Nations, as well as many other charity relief projects such as Oxfam, UNICEF, and
		the Australian Red Cross, IC-ENC will be releasing two up-to-date ENCs of Port
		Vila, produced by UKHO. These two ENCs are now available unencrypted and free
		of charge via the IC-ENC website, and will also be included in this week's exchange
		set.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		On a separate note, James attended the North Indian Ocean Hydrographic
		Commission (NIOHC) meeting in Oman, which was held from 16th ‚Äì 18th March. At
		the meeting, James delivered a joint presentation with Cdr. Ahmed Naguib from the
		Egyptian Navy Hydrographic Department (ENHD). The presentation provided an
		insight into ENHD's experiences of IC-ENC as a new member, and discussed IC-
		ENC's provision of services and production support to ENHD during the joining
		period.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The flow of data into IC-ENC remains high, with week 11 containing 239
		individual ENC files, which makes it our largest exchange set since 2011. As a
		result, the total number of issued ENCs now stands at 5,535 as of week 13. Whilst
		on the topic of data, here is a quick reminder that this week's exchange set (week
		14) will be released a day early, on Thursday 2nd April 2015.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		On a final note, I wish everyone a very Happy Easter!

		The South Pacific island chain of Vanuatu was devastated on March 13th by
		Cyclone Pam.  This event is now regarded as one of the most severe tropical
		cyclone disasters in the history of Vanuatu, and has resulted in the tragic loss of 16
		lives.  The majority of the damage is at the capital of Port Vila, although other parts
		of the 65 inhabited islands have also been affected by the natural disaster.  The
		United Nations have confirmed that humanitarian aid has been delivered to all of the
		affected islands of the country, providing food packages and water for more than
		166,000 people, however,  this important work will continue for as long as necessary
		in support of the affected communities. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO), which is the primary charting
		authority for Vanuatu, has decided to rapidly issue new editions of two Vanuatu ENC
		cells in response to the disaster.  These new editions, GB501638 Northern Vanuatu
		- Espiritu Santo - Luganville and GB501494 Port Vila are to be distributed through
		IC-ENC on a free of charge basis for use by all interested parties and to assist with
		the humanitarian relief effort. At the first opportunity, these cells will be included
		within the weekly exchange set to the IC-ENC Value Added Reseller (VAR) network.
		They will also be available to download on the IC-ENC website by clicking here.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Both IC-ENC and UKHO are pleased to be able to support the international
		community at this challenging time.

		<div class="news-card-author"><p>by Laura Tyzack at 14:00 in <a href="Catagories - Announcements.html" class="news-styling" style="text-decoration: none;">Announcements</a></p></div>

		<br>

		‚ÄãSadly, I must inform you that Lieutenant Marcelo Olivera has now left his position as
		Head of Cartography of SOHMA (Hydrographic Office of Uruguay). I speak on
		behalf of the whole IC-ENC team when I say that it has always been a pleasure to
		work with Marcelo. His enthusiastic and friendly emails were always well received,
		displaying a close working relationship with the whole team, even though a couple
		of us have never had the opportunity to meet him face-to-face!  
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Marcelo first joined the Naval Academy of his country in 2001, getting his degree in
		2004. After two years integrating the crews of Sailing Ships of Uruguay and Mexico
		(including a trip around the world of 10 months in the latter), he was assigned to the
		Hydrographic Ship ROU22 "Oyarvide" in 2007. Between 2008 and 2009 he made
		his specialization in Hydrography at the Postgraduate School of the Venezuelan
		Navy and in the last five years, he has served as Head of Cartography Branch in
		SOHMA, Uruguay. Here, he worked closely with IC-ENC in order to improve both
		the quality and availability of cartographic products of his country.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Today, Marcelo will be rejoining the Hydrographic Ship ROU22 'Oyarvide', which he
		was previously assigned to, as Head of Surveys and Operations.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Marcelo has kindly provided us with a few words that he would like to share to the
		IC-ENC community:
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		"My arrival at the Hydrographic Office of Uruguay, and my assignment as Head of
		the Cartography Branch in 2010 coincided with the signing of the agreement
		between SOHMA and IC-ENC and the first steps on the path to integration to the
		aforementioned RENC. By then, the challenge was great and of course we do not
		have any previous experience that supports us.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The process took some time, in which the 'Joining Instructions' were an extremely
		valuable tool for guidance and orientation. Furthermore, at this stage the patience
		and support that each of the members of the IC-ENC had with us, assisting and
		advising us in the process of designing an ENC that meets the standards of
		validation was invaluable. In January 2012, exactly one year after the delivery of our
		first batch of cells, they were approved, starting their distribution.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		My experience over the years working with the IC-ENC is that human warmth and
		generous disposition of each of its members, makes contact to be very close. It
		could be defined as a "group of friends at a distance" which often do not know each
		other in person, but let your work with ENCs to be a pleasant and enjoyable
		experience.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Now that I am leaving Cartography Branch in order to take on a new challenge in
		my naval career, SOHMA has reached 27 cells distributed worldwide through the
		RENC, with at least 15 additional cells in preparation for this 2015. I would like
		express my deep appreciation to the staff of IC-ENC for all the learning and
		experience they have shared with me over the years and the staff of the Electronic
		Cartography Division of SOHMA, by the tireless effort of preparing products which
		matches the greater level of world requirement.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		I wish you all "fair winds" and that collaboration between SOHMA and IC-ENC
		keeps growing every day more and more.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Hasta pronto!"

		It's been a busy month down here in IC-ENC. In addition to hosting our first training
		course of 2015, we have also had a sharp rise in the amount of incoming data which
		has kept the validation team occupied (to say the least!), as well as several
		meetings and visits.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Following on from the first week of the training course, the delegates spent the
		weekend exploring the local area. On Saturday, a few of the delegates spent the
		day in Bath, and on Sunday, IC-ENC organised a day trip down to Lyme Regis, a
		small seaside town on the South coast of England. Luckily it was a lovely sunny day
		(the past few days it had been pouring with rain!), so the delegates were able to
		make the most of it. We also organised a couple of evenings during the two week
		period for the team and the delegates to relax and enjoy a friendly drink together.

		Some of the topics covered in the second week included data consistency, where
		the delegates were able to discuss their views on the use of SCAMIN and the
		problems associated with overlapping data in detail, as well as the distribution of
		data where the delegates learnt about S-63 (Data Protection Scheme) and the route
		to the market place via the IC-ENC VARs. In addition, the delegates had the
		opportunity to get hands on with the Transas ECDIS, helping them to put some of
		their learning into practice.

		Invitations for the delegates selected to attend this course will be sent out very
		shortly.
		
		<br>

		On a final note, we hope that those of you who attended our first training course
		enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed hosting it!

		On the data front, we are pleased to announce that the first 17 Philippines cells sent
		to IC-ENC were released to the market place for distribution by our VARs on 27th
		February 2015. As of week 10, this addition brings our total number of issued ENCs
		to 5,500!

		Richard Fowle, IC-ENC Technical Manager, attended the Joint TSMAD29 and
		DIPWG7 meeting which was held in Ottawa, Canada from 2nd-6th February. The
		meeting was well attended by both Hydrographic Offices and Industries. Individual
		reports were given to the meeting group regarding the activities of other IHO
		Working Groups and organisations, and as a result there were some good
		discussions surrounding the topics of S-58, S-100 and S-101. Some of the main
		outcomes of the meeting were the further developments regarding S-101, and the
		restructuring of TSMAD and DIPWG, which have now been replaced by the S-
		100WG and ENCWG. If you are interested in finding out more about the Joint
		TSMAD29 and DIPWG7 meeting, the minutes will be available on the IHB website
		in the near future. In addition, more information on the new S-100WG and ENCWG
		can be found on the IHO website.

		James attended the 6th RSAHC meeting in Abu Dhabi, which took place from 9th-
		11th February. James presented on IC-ENC services, with a particular focus on
		capacity building and our first training course of 2015. The presentation was well
		received, and some interesting questions were asked. Additionally, James met
		several new contacts from our existing members Pakistan and Bahrain, and
		continued to develop IC-ENC's relationship with several prospective new members.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		On 27th February, We had a visit from Commander Nickol√°s Roscher, Directorate of
		Hydrography and Navigation at the Brazilian HO (DHN). Nickol√°s spent the day with
		the team, learning about our core services and some of the main processes we
		perform on a daily basis. We believe that visits such as these provide a
		great opportunity to develop and strengthen our working relationships with one
		another.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		James and Mathias have also just attended the 5th WENDWG meeting, which was
		held in Singapore from 3rd ‚Äì 5th March. At the meeting, James presented a RENC
		progress report, based on the 2014 Annual Report, which was well received by the
		group and sparked some interesting discussions. The main topics of discussion
		included the issues surrounding overlapping data, and the method of assessing
		progress on delivering adequate ENC coverage to support the mandation of ECDIS,
		the IHO ENC catalogue, and the S-101 future standard. As a direct result of this
		meeting, IC-ENC will be collaborating with the Maritime and Port Authority of
		Singapore (MPA) in order to investigate the effects of overlapping ENCs on various
		types of ECDIS, including both behaviour and display of data.

		James Harper, IC-ENC Manager, and Mathias Jonas, IC-ENC Chairman both
		attended the 5th IHO WENDWG meeting, which was held in Singapore from 3rd-5th
		March. 

		<br>
		<br>
		
		The WENDWG (Worldwide ENC Database Working Group) is an IHO group, and
		subsidiary of the Inter Regional Coordination Committee (IRCC) which is
		responsible for advising the IRCC on the development and monitoring of the
		principles, guidelines and governance surrounding the WEND. As a result, the
		WENDWG aims to facilitate a worldwide consistent level of high quality, updated
		official ENCs through integrated services that support SOLAS carriage requirements
		and the IMO Performance Standards for ECDIS.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		At the meeting, IC-ENC presented a RENC progress report, based on the 2014
		Annual Report, which was well received by the group, and as a result sparked some
		good discussions. The main topics of discussions included the problems and
		solutions to overlapping ENCs, and the method of assessing progress on delivering
