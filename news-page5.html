		  The IC-ENC Validation Team have been busy training to use the new internal
		  validation tool that has been developed to replace the Data Management Database
		  (DMD) system.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The International Teams from the Australia, North America and Latin America offices
		  joined the rest of the team at IC-ENC UK for three weeks during January/February.
		  During this time, the team were introduced to the new bespoke software tool in
		  order to familiarise themselves with some of the new functionality and processes,
		  whilst acting as a final User Acceptance Testing process, reporting back any issues
		  encountered. During the final week, the team began to conduct their validations
		  using the new tool and share ideas regarding new best practice.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The International Teams emphasised the benefit of having the team in one place to
		  maximise learning and understanding of the new tool during a short period of time,
		  as the team were able to share ideas for best practice and discuss any issues they
		  encountered during the training. This has helped to ensure that they felt confident in
		  using the tool upon returning to their home offices. Their training and performance
		  progress was overseen by the IC-ENC Data Manager as part of the team's
		  Continuous Professional Development.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  As well as a productive three weeks of training, the team made sure they made the
		  most of their time together in the UK by organising several out-of-office team
		  building/social events, equally important as the functional training.

		 Since The Ports and Yachting Directorate for Transport Malta, joined IC-ENC in
		 February, IC-ENC has been working closely with Malta in order to develop its ENC
		 production capacity.  We are now very happy to announce that IC-ENC will release
		 the first Maltese (MT coded) ENC in this week's IC-ENC exchange set on
		 Friday 29th July 2016, with more to follow in upcoming weeks.
		 
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 
		 Not only is this a great step forward for Malta in terms of providing important
		 coverage for the region, but this also means that IC-ENC has reached a significant
		 milestone of having more than 6,000 ENCs in its folio, which now accounts for 40%
		 of the global folio of released ENCs.

		  We are now part way through the first week of the IC-ENC International ENC
		  Validation training course, which is taking place from 4th-15th July at the United
		  Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) in Taunton, UK. Eleven delegates from nine
		  nations have joined us for two weeks to learn about the ENC Validation process
		  from start to finish, thus giving them the knowledge and skills to be able to perform
		  ENC Validation when they return to their home offices. The course will also include
		  familiarisation with the eGlobe G2 ECDIS in order to encourage the use of ECDIS in
		  Hydrographic Offices' ENC production and validation processes. All IC-ENC
		  members have been provided with the eGlobe ECDIS software to take back to their
		  home offices.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>

		  <a href="Blog Post 45.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><h6>New ENC coverage for the Panama Canal and Approaches</h6></a>
		  
		  <div class="news-card-author"><p>by Laura Tyzack at 09:45 in <a href="Catagories - Announcements.html" class="news-styling" style="text-decoration: none;">Announcements</a></p></div>

		  IC-ENC is pleased to announce that it has now formalised membership
		  arrangements with the Panama Canal Authority and Panama Maritime Authority,
		  both of which provide critical ENC coverage for international maritime trade.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  IC-ENC concluded membership arrangements with the Panama Maritime Authority
		  (PMA) early in 2015, and the first tranche of coverage was released in December
		  2015. PMA's responsibilities are to chart Panamanian water except for the areas
		  around and including the Canal. 
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  Subsequently, IC-ENC is pleased to announce that membership arrangements with
		  the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) have been finalised, and five new ENCs have
		  been released in this week's exchange set. These new ENCs cover the entire extent
		  of PCA's 'Area of Operation'. The IC-ENC Validation and Technical teams have
		  supported this production through detailed validation and quality assurance work.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The Panama Canal Expansion is the largest project since its original construction in
		  1914. The project will create a new lane of traffic along the Canal through the
		  construction of a new set of locks, doubling the waterway's capacity. The existing
		  locks allow the passage of vessels that can carry up to 5,000 TEUs. 
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The Program consists of several components:
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  New Locks (Third Set of Locks)
		  <br>
		  Pacific Access Channel
		  <br>
		  Improvement of Navigational Channels (Dredging)
		  <br>
		  Improvements to Water Supply
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  The new locks are supported by new approach channels, including a 6.2km
		  channel at Miraflores. Each of these channels are 720ft wide, and after the
		  expansion, the Post-Panamax vessels will be able to transit through the Canal, with
		  up to 13,000/14,000 TEUs. The Expansion will double the Canal's capacity, having a
		  direct impact on economies of scale and international maritime trade. The new ENC
		  coverage provided by both authorities will support the new, wider, canal areas.

		  IC-ENC welcomes Le Centre D'hydrographie et D'oceanographie de la Marine
		  Nationale (Tunisian Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Centre) (CHOMN,
		  Tunisia) working with Le Centre National de la cartographie et de la Télédétection
		  (National Centre for Cartography and Remote Sensing) (CNCT, Tunisia), which has
		  become its 40th member. The documentation was signed during IC-ENC's Technical
		  Conference 2016 (27th April - 29th April) held in Taunton, UK.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  IC-ENC will work closely with Tunisia and provide support in order to assist the
		  development of its ENC production capacity.  This will be achieved through IC-
		  ENC's Production Support, Independent Validation and Capacity Building (Training)
		  services.
		  
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
		  IC-ENC is looking forward to working in partnership with Tunisia and assisting in the
		  development of this important ENC coverage in the Mediterranean region.

		  Its been another busy couple of months for IC-ENC. One of our main focuses has
		  been on the training of the four new international validation staff. These staff have
		  been based at IC-ENC HQ since the end of January to complete three months of IC-
		  ENC Validation and Regional Office training in preparation for when they start their
		  roles at the new IC-ENC Latin America and IC-ENC North America regional offices.
		  These two new regional offices are expected to be set up during 2016.

		IC-ENC had several visits during March. We were delighted to welcome the
		Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) to IC-ENC UK for the first time. We also
		welcomed back John Nyberg from NOAA, and a delegation from the Dirección de
		Hidrografía y Navegación (DHN).
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Aside from training, we have been busy preparing for the first IC-ENC Technical
		Conference, which will take place from 27th to 29th April 2016 in Taunton, UK. We
		are currently finalising travel and accommodation arrangements, so if your office
		hasn't already confirmed its attendance, please contact Liz Hahessy by email at
		liz.hahessy@ic-enc.org as soon as possible.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		In addition, we are also starting to prepare for the next Steering Committee meeting
		in September, so please make every effort to return your completed travel forms if
		your office would like to be represented. For all Steering Committee related queries,
		please contact Laura Tyzack by email at laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org.
