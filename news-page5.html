		Firstly, thank you for all of your positive comments on the first blog post; I'm so glad
		that you enjoyed reading it. As a result, I'm back with blog number two!
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC is now half way through the first training course of 2015, which is being held
		here in Taunton for a two week period from 2nd – 13th February.  Eleven delegates
		were selected to attend the course from various different regions of the world:
		Belgium, Egypt, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, South
		Africa, and Spain.  So far, the delegates have been learning about IC-ENC's roles
		and responsibilities, as well as its core processes such as how we download and
		register data from our members.

		<br>
		<br>
		
		The training course aims to provide the knowledge and skills required to carry out
		the various aspects of ENC Validation back at their home offices.  In addition,
		delegates will be able to demonstrate an understanding of IC-ENC, the relevant
		international standards, and the content and construction of ENCs by validating
		ENC data and investigating the reported errors.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		We also intend for our training courses to bring our members together to share
		ideas and build strong working relationships with one another, therefore showing us
		as a truly international organisation.  In addition, the delegates also have the
		opportunity to meet and build working relationships with the team at the IC-ENC UK
		office.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		There will be two more training courses delivered during 2015, one in Latin America
		and one in Australia.  If you are interested in attending one of our training courses,
		please see the IC-ENC website or contact Mike Hawes (Course Instructor) at
		mike.hawes@ic-enc.org for more information.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		We have also enjoyed a visit from Dr Mathias Jonas, IC-ENC Chairman, to the IC-
		ENC HQ office in Taunton on 5th February.  Mathias was introduced to the course
		delegates before spending the rest of the day with the each member of the IC-ENC
		team to gain a full understanding of all the services IC-ENC provides, as well as
		some of the current project work that each team member is working on.

		On the data front, IC-ENC has now released all of the Italian ENCs to the market
		place for distribution by our VARs.  As a result, 253 additional ENCs have been
		added to our catalogue, which brings our total number of issued ENCs to 5,473!

		This month also saw the release of Real Time Reporting (RTR), the new IC-ENC
		business system, which has been one of Richard Northover's main projects since he
		joined as IC-ENC Commercial Manager in March 2014.  The main features of the
		system include automated XML based sales orders, from VARs, submitted on a 24
		hour basis via email, fully automated sales order processing, immediate automated
		VAR receipts or error reports via email, and automated monthly VAR invoicing.  This
		new system will provide immediate benefits including a robust, streamlined and
		automated sales order process for both the VARs and IC-ENC with the elimination
		of manually induced errors. In addition, RTR will provide the ability to customise
		reporting for members on far more elements than has previously been possible.

		Further afield, James will be attending the 6th Meeting of the RSAHC, which will be
		held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 9th – 11th February. James will be
		there to meet with current and potential members, so please do go and introduce
		yourself if you are also attending.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Looking ahead to September, IC-ENC is pleased to announce that this year's
		Steering Committee Meeting will be held in Munich from 7th – 8th September. The
		meeting will be held at the Holiday Inn Munich – City Centre hotel. All invitations
		were sent out on Friday 23rd January, so please make every effort to respond by
		Monday 16th February, and if you have any questions please contact me at
		laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org.

		Now we're already a few weeks into the New Year, we thought it would be a great
		opportunity to give a round up on last year's achievements. There is no doubt that
		2014 has been a busy year for IC-ENC, but we have a lot to show for it. From
		welcoming six new members, to launching our ENC Validation training course,
		we've been kept on our toes at all times.  
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		2014 has seen a dramatic increase in membership, and IC-ENC welcomes
		Suriname, The Philippines, Slovenia, Italy, Egypt and Malaysia to our family of
		members, bringing the total number of IC-ENC members to 34. All of these nations
		will provide important coverage for the IC-ENC ENC folio, and we are now working
		to incorporate all of the ENCs into our database.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		As part of a capacity building initiative, IC-ENC successfully launched its ENC
		Validation training course in March, delivering the pilot course to three delegates:
		two from Greece and one from the Netherlands. The pilot course was a huge
		success, and as a result there will be three courses delivered throughout 2015.

		We had another successful Steering Committee meeting in September, which saw
		the highest number of participants to date. It was great to have so many of our
		member nations together to discuss issues and ideas, and set the strategic direction
		for the year ahead. The end of the meeting saw IC-ENC Chairman Capt. Peter
		Kortenoeven complete his two year tenure, followed by the election and
		appointment of the new IC-ENC Chairman, Dr. Mathias Jonas, and two Vice
		Chairmen, Jens Peter Hartmann and Cdr. Ricardo Lopez Cruz. Capt. Peter
		Kortenoeven, and his family, have since temporarily moved to Ethiopia to embrace
		the African way of life.

		In addition to the Steering Committee, IC-ENC has also attended various
		Hydrographic commissions and conferences throughout the year. In particular, IC-
		ENC attended the Extraordinary International Hydrographic Conference (EIHC) in
		October. This was an excellent opportunity to represent IC-ENC globally and to
		promote the service which we provide, whilst working in harmony with our RENC
		colleagues from PRIMAR. Additionally, it was great to see so many of you there
		visiting our exhibition stand.

		A little closer to home at the IC-ENC UK office, Richard Northover was appointed as
		IC-ENC Commercial Manager in March. Richard has been focused on ENC
		licensing considerations and Real Time Reporting, amongst other commercial
		responsibilities.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Whilst down under at the IC-ENC Australia office, the team has continued to provide
		a high level of support to both the local region and to us here at the IC-ENC UK
		office with their frequent ideas and suggestions to improve the service that IC-ENC
		provides.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Looking to the year ahead, we are excited to continue delivering and improving our
		service for our members. We look forward to delivering the first training course of
		2015 in February here in Taunton to eleven delegates from Europe and beyond.
		Further courses will follow in Australia and Latin America. Not only does the course
		emphasise our dedication towards capacity building, but it also shows our
		enthusiasm to pass on our ENC expertise to our members, with the anticipated
		result of creating and managing a more seamless ENC folio, all for the benefit of the
		mariner.

			IC-ENC is proud to announce that the National Mapping and Resource Information
			Authority (NAMRIA) of Philippines has become the 30th National Hydrographic
			Office to join its rapidly increasing family of members.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			NAMRIA has issued ENCs in the General, Approach and Harbour usage bands,
			which is supplemented by coverage produced by  the United Kingdom Hydrographic
			Office.  IC-ENC will now be supporting NAMRIA, to develop further its in-house ENC
			production capacity, via its Production Support, Independent Validation and
			Capacity Building (Training) services. NAMRIA intends to assume production and
			maintenance responsibilities for approximately 150 ENCs of its national waters and
			the surrounding area. This is important new coverage in the IC-ENC ENC folio.

			Hydrographic Offices.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Suriname has four ENCs which are produced in co-operation with the Netherlands

			(MAS) to develop its own ENC production capability. In time, MAS will take over
			future production and maintenance of the ENCs in this region.

		The 28 IC-ENC member nations have recently achieved a significant landmark in
		their ENC coverage. 
		<br>
		By working together (and with the assistance of the IC-ENC RENC) these nations
		have produced and are maintaining a folio that is now made up of over 5000 ENCs! 
		Each of the co-operating nations has overcome its own unique challenges in order
		to reach this stage of production. 
		<br>
		The combined IC-ENC ENC database with its focus on data quality and consistency
		will grow further as the members continue with their production schedule and new
		nations join the IC-ENC RENC.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The sizes of the individual national folios are shown by this graph:

		The presentation was well received by the audience of Hydrographic Offices,
		industry stakeholders and the IHB. 
		<br>
		It covered RENC aspects such as membership, operations, data flow and
		finances. A single combined presentation from both RENCs is part of the
		continued initiative regarding technical co-operation.
