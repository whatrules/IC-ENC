	Firstly, thank you for all of your positive comments on the first blog post; I'm so glad
	that you enjoyed reading it. As a result, I'm back with blog number two!
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	IC-ENC is now half way through the first training course of 2015, which is being held
	here in Taunton for a two week period from 2nd – 13th February.  Eleven delegates
	were selected to attend the course from various different regions of the world:
	Belgium, Egypt, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, South
	Africa, and Spain.  So far, the delegates have been learning about IC-ENC's roles
	and responsibilities, as well as its core processes such as how we download and
	register data from our members.

	<br>
	<br>
	
	The training course aims to provide the knowledge and skills required to carry out
	the various aspects of ENC Validation back at their home offices.  In addition,
	delegates will be able to demonstrate an understanding of IC-ENC, the relevant
	international standards, and the content and construction of ENCs by validating
	ENC data and investigating the reported errors.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	We also intend for our training courses to bring our members together to share
	ideas and build strong working relationships with one another, therefore showing us
	as a truly international organisation.  In addition, the delegates also have the
	opportunity to meet and build working relationships with the team at the IC-ENC UK
	office.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	There will be two more training courses delivered during 2015, one in Latin America
	and one in Australia.  If you are interested in attending one of our training courses,
	please see the IC-ENC website or contact Mike Hawes (Course Instructor) at
	mike.hawes@ic-enc.org for more information.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	We have also enjoyed a visit from Dr Mathias Jonas, IC-ENC Chairman, to the IC-
	ENC HQ office in Taunton on 5th February.  Mathias was introduced to the course
	delegates before spending the rest of the day with the each member of the IC-ENC
	team to gain a full understanding of all the services IC-ENC provides, as well as
	some of the current project work that each team member is working on.

	On the data front, IC-ENC has now released all of the Italian ENCs to the market
	place for distribution by our VARs.  As a result, 253 additional ENCs have been
	added to our catalogue, which brings our total number of issued ENCs to 5,473!

	This month also saw the release of Real Time Reporting (RTR), the new IC-ENC
	business system, which has been one of Richard Northover's main projects since he
	joined as IC-ENC Commercial Manager in March 2014.  The main features of the
	system include automated XML based sales orders, from VARs, submitted on a 24
	hour basis via email, fully automated sales order processing, immediate automated
	VAR receipts or error reports via email, and automated monthly VAR invoicing.  This
	new system will provide immediate benefits including a robust, streamlined and
	automated sales order process for both the VARs and IC-ENC with the elimination
	of manually induced errors. In addition, RTR will provide the ability to customise
	reporting for members on far more elements than has previously been possible.

	Further afield, James will be attending the 6th Meeting of the RSAHC, which will be
	held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 9th – 11th February. James will be
	there to meet with current and potential members, so please do go and introduce
	yourself if you are also attending.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Looking ahead to September, IC-ENC is pleased to announce that this year's
	Steering Committee Meeting will be held in Munich from 7th – 8th September. The
	meeting will be held at the Holiday Inn Munich – City Centre hotel. All invitations
	were sent out on Friday 23rd January, so please make every effort to respond by
	Monday 16th February, and if you have any questions please contact me at
	laura.tyzack@ic-enc.org.

	Now we're already a few weeks into the New Year, we thought it would be a great
	opportunity to give a round up on last year's achievements. There is no doubt that
	2014 has been a busy year for IC-ENC, but we have a lot to show for it. From
	welcoming six new members, to launching our ENC Validation training course,
	we've been kept on our toes at all times.  
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	2014 has seen a dramatic increase in membership, and IC-ENC welcomes
	Suriname, The Philippines, Slovenia, Italy, Egypt and Malaysia to our family of
	members, bringing the total number of IC-ENC members to 34. All of these nations
	will provide important coverage for the IC-ENC ENC folio, and we are now working
	to incorporate all of the ENCs into our database.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	As part of a capacity building initiative, IC-ENC successfully launched its ENC
	Validation training course in March, delivering the pilot course to three delegates:
	two from Greece and one from the Netherlands. The pilot course was a huge
	success, and as a result there will be three courses delivered throughout 2015.

	We had another successful Steering Committee meeting in September, which saw
	the highest number of participants to date. It was great to have so many of our
	member nations together to discuss issues and ideas, and set the strategic direction
	for the year ahead. The end of the meeting saw IC-ENC Chairman Capt. Peter
	Kortenoeven complete his two year tenure, followed by the election and
	appointment of the new IC-ENC Chairman, Dr. Mathias Jonas, and two Vice
	Chairmen, Jens Peter Hartmann and Cdr. Ricardo Lopez Cruz. Capt. Peter
	Kortenoeven, and his family, have since temporarily moved to Ethiopia to embrace
	the African way of life.

	In addition to the Steering Committee, IC-ENC has also attended various
	Hydrographic commissions and conferences throughout the year. In particular, IC-
	ENC attended the Extraordinary International Hydrographic Conference (EIHC) in
	October. This was an excellent opportunity to represent IC-ENC globally and to
	promote the service which we provide, whilst working in harmony with our RENC
	colleagues from PRIMAR. Additionally, it was great to see so many of you there
	visiting our exhibition stand.

	A little closer to home at the IC-ENC UK office, Richard Northover was appointed as
	IC-ENC Commercial Manager in March. Richard has been focused on ENC
	licensing considerations and Real Time Reporting, amongst other commercial
	responsibilities.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Whilst down under at the IC-ENC Australia office, the team has continued to provide
	a high level of support to both the local region and to us here at the IC-ENC UK
	office with their frequent ideas and suggestions to improve the service that IC-ENC
	provides.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Looking to the year ahead, we are excited to continue delivering and improving our
	service for our members. We look forward to delivering the first training course of
	2015 in February here in Taunton to eleven delegates from Europe and beyond.
	Further courses will follow in Australia and Latin America. Not only does the course
	emphasise our dedication towards capacity building, but it also shows our
	enthusiasm to pass on our ENC expertise to our members, with the anticipated
	result of creating and managing a more seamless ENC folio, all for the benefit of the
	mariner.

		IC-ENC would like to announce that the Egyptian Navy Hydrographic Department
		(ENHD) has become the 33rd National Hydrographic Office to join its ever
		expanding family of members. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		ENHD currently has a folio of 28 ENCs, providing significant coverage in and around
		the major shipping thoroughfare of the Suez Canal.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC is looking to incorporate ENHD's ENCs into its database during 2015, and
		will then be working with ENHD to support further development of its ENC coverage.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		This adds important new coverage to the IC-ENC ENC folio, and IC-ENC is looking
		forward to building a long-standing business relationship with ENHD.

		IC-ENC is proud to announce that the Istituto Idrografico della Marina (IIM) of Italy
		has become the 32nd National Hydrographic Office to join its ever increasing global
		family of members.

		<br>
		<br>
		
		IIM currently has a folio of 252 ENCs, providing significant coverage within the
		Mediterranean region.

		<br>
		<br>
		
		IC-ENC is looking to incorporate IIM’s ENCs into its database by 1st January 2015,
		and will then be working with IIM to support further development of its ENC
		coverage.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		This will establish new coverage in the IC-ENC ENC folio, and IC-ENC is looking
		forward to building a long-standing business relationship with IIM.

	The 28 IC-ENC member nations have recently achieved a significant landmark in
	their ENC coverage. 
	<br>
	By working together (and with the assistance of the IC-ENC RENC) these nations
	have produced and are maintaining a folio that is now made up of over 5000 ENCs! 
	Each of the co-operating nations has overcome its own unique challenges in order
	to reach this stage of production. 
	<br>
	The combined IC-ENC ENC database with its focus on data quality and consistency
	will grow further as the members continue with their production schedule and new
	nations join the IC-ENC RENC.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	The sizes of the individual national folios are shown by this graph:
